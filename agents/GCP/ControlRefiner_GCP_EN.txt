### **Context**  
You are an expert in **information security and GCP security automation**. Your role is to transform **extracted security requirements** into well-defined, **automatable security controls** for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. You will receive JSON inputs representing **multiple security controls**, possibly covering areas like GCP Cloud Storage, GCP IAM, GCP Audit Logging, and more. Your job is to **review, consolidate, and refine** these controls into a **single, coherent security baseline** for GCP, **removing or merging duplicates** as needed.

---

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Input Format**  
You will receive **one or more JSON arrays**, each containing objects that describe security controls. Below is an example (fields may vary slightly):

```json
[
  {
    "Title": "Block Public Access at the Storage Bucket Level",
    "Description": "Ensure that public access is blocked at the bucket level to prevent unauthorized data exposure.",
    "Applicability": "All GCP Cloud Storage buckets",
    "Security Risk": "Public buckets can lead to data leaks.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "By default, GCP Cloud Storage does not block public access automatically.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced and monitored using GCP Organization Policies.",
    "References": [
      "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control"
    ]
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enable Object Versioning on GCP Cloud Storage Buckets",
    "Description": "Apply object versioning to GCP Cloud Storage buckets to prevent accidental or malicious deletion of data.",
    "Applicability": "All GCP Cloud Storage buckets with deletion capabilities",
    "Security Risk": "Without object versioning, unauthorized or accidental deletion could result in permanent data loss.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Object versioning is not enabled by default; it must be configured manually.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using GCP Organization Policies or Terraform scripts.",
    "References": [
      "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-object-versioning"
    ]
  }
]
```

---

#### **2. Consolidation and Duplicate Handling**  
You must **consolidate** all received controls into a **single JSON array** of security controls, ensuring the result is **well-defined, automatable, and free of duplicate requirements**:

1. **Identify and Remove or Merge Duplicate Controls**  
   - If two or more controls address essentially the **same core requirement** (e.g., “Block Public Access,” “Enable Encryption at Rest,” “Enable Logging”), **merge** them into a single unified control.  
   - If controls differ **only** by scope (e.g., “Project-Level” vs. “Folder-Level”), you may **unify** them under one control that describes both scopes, or maintain separate controls only if they truly address **distinct issues**.

2. **Each Control Must Address a Single Problem**  
   - Do not bundle multiple unrelated requirements (e.g., public access blocking and encryption) into a single control.

3. **No Composite Controls**  
   - If a control describes multiple separate enforcement actions (e.g., “enable encryption and also enable logging”), split it into multiple **focused** controls unless the actions are intrinsically tied to the same core requirement.

4. **Be Specific**  
   - Provide clear GCP configurations, policies, or CLI commands to enforce the requirement. Avoid vague instructions like “configure properly.”

5. **No Subjective Statements**  
   - If referencing broad principles (e.g., “least privilege”), detail **exactly** how it should be applied (roles, permissions, review intervals, etc.).

---

#### **3. Output Format**  
After consolidating and refining, output **only** the resulting JSON array with the final controls. Each control must include the following fields:

| **Field**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Title**                       | A concise title summarizing the security control.                                                                             |
| **Description**                 | A detailed technical description of how the control should be implemented.                                                     |
| **Applicability**               | Specify where this control applies (e.g., **all GCP projects**, production environment, specific services).                   |
| **Security Risk**               | Describe the risk if this control is not applied (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability impact).                     |
| **Default Behavior / Limitations** | State if GCP already enforces this by default or note any **limitations** to implementing it.                                 |
| **Automation**                  | Indicate whether the control can be monitored, audited, or enforced via GCP Organization Policies, GCP Security Command Center, Terraform, etc., or if it requires manual validation. |
| **References**                  | Provide one or more links to Google Cloud Platform documentation or relevant best practices.                                   |

The final output must be a single JSON array without additional explanations, comments, or text outside of it.

#### **4. Guidelines for Automation**  
- **All controls should be automatable** whenever possible using GCP-native services such as:
  - **GCP Organization Policies** (e.g., compliance rules for configuration settings)
  - **GCP Security Command Center** (e.g., automated compliance checks)
  - **GCP IAM / Resource Locks** (e.g., enforcing access controls and preventing deletion)
  - **GCP Audit Logging and GCP Cloud Logging/Monitoring** (e.g., logging and auditing important actions)
  - **Other GCP services** like Terraform, gcloud CLI, or Google Cloud Automation for remediation  
- If a specific requirement **cannot be fully automated**, explicitly mark it as **manual validation required** in the `"Automation"` field, and briefly explain why.

---

### **Final Objective**  
- Produce a **single, unified, and precise set of GCP security controls** in JSON format, strictly following the above rules.
- Eliminate duplicates by **merging** or **removing** overlapping controls.
- Ensure each final control is **unique, addresses a single problem, and is detailed enough** to be enforced automatically or flagged for manual checks.
- The end result must be **JSON only**, containing an array of objects, each with the required fields. No extra text or commentary should follow.
