    "Title": "Enforce AES256 Encryption for Huawei Cloud Data",
    "Risk Description": "Unencrypted data increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, compromising confidentiality and integrity, and could lead to regulatory non-compliance.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unencrypted data can be accessed by unauthorized entities, exposing sensitive customer information.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Lack of encryption might allow undetected tampering or manipulation of data.",
      "Availability": "Low - Encryption primarily impacts data confidentiality and integrity, not availability directly."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Lack of data encryption could violate LGPD's requirements for protecting personal data, as well as PCI DSS and ISO 27001 standards.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Encryption failures can often go unnoticed until a breach occurs, but detection through monitoring is feasible.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"

    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Misconfigurations can be detected through network monitoring tools, but may require robust processes.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Automated Security Patch Management for Huawei RDS",
    "Risk Description": "Failure to apply security patches promptly leaves system vulnerabilities exposed to exploitation, risking data integrity and confidentiality.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Vulnerabilities can be exploited to access sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Exploitation could lead to unauthorized data modifications.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Vulnerabilities may lead to service outages or disruptions."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Delayed patch management could result in non-compliance with ISO 27001 controls for vulnerability management.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Vulnerabilities require active scanning and prioritization to mitigate.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Secure Temporary Operator Access Monitoring",
    "Risk Description": "Uncontrolled temporary access can lead to unauthorized actions, increasing risks of financial fraud or data compromise.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unauthorized access could expose sensitive customer data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Temporary access misuse could manipulate data.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Misuse of access has potential for operational disruptions."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Lapses in access control management could violate BACEN and LGPD requirements for data protection and accountability.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Requires robust monitoring and auditing mechanisms to detect abuse of temporary access.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Implement Immutable Backups for Huawei Cloud Databases",
    "Risk Description": "Loss or tampering of database backups can significantly affect data recovery processes and compromise system resilience.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Unauthorized access to backups could expose data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Tampered backups can compromise the integrity of restored data.",
      "Availability": "High - Unavailable or corrupted backups hinder recovery operations."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Inadequate backup protection can breach ISO 27001 and PCI DSS requirements for data retention and recovery.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Tampering may not be immediately apparent, requiring regular integrity checks.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Deploy Robust IAM Policies for Access Control",
    "Risk Description": "Weak access control policies can lead to unauthorized access and actions, posing significant threats to data security.",
