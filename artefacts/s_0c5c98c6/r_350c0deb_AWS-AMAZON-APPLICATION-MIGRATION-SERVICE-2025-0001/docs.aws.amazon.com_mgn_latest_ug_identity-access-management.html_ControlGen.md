    "Title": "Explicit IAM Policy for AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)",
    "Description": "Create a specific IAM policy that grants necessary permissions for users to manage AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) resources. Attach this policy to IAM users or groups that require access.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM users who require access to AWS MGN resources",
    "Security Risk": "Without explicit permissions, users cannot manage AWS MGN resources, potentially impacting operations that depend on this service.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "By default, users have no permissions to AWS MGN resources. Permissions must be explicitly granted.",
    "Automation": "Can be managed through IAM by creating custom policies and using AWS Config to ensure policy compliance.",

    "Title": "Enforce Federation for AWS Access using Identity Providers",
    "Description": "Configure AWS IAM roles with policies for federated users to access AWS services using temporary credentials through an identity provider. This setup must use AWS Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary access.",
    "Applicability": "All human users, including those with administrative access requirements",
    "Security Risk": "Permanent credentials pose a risk of unauthorized access if compromised. Federated access reduces this risk by using temporary credentials.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS accounts do not enforce federation by default. Requires integration with identity providers.",
    "Automation": "Implement through AWS IAM by configuring identity providers and roles with suitable trust policies, enforce via AWS Config and Security Hub.",

  {
    "Title": "Centralized Access Management with AWS IAM Identity Center",
    "Description": "Use AWS IAM Identity Center to centralize user and group management across AWS accounts and applications. Integrate with external identity providers to synchronize user and group data.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using multiple applications or needing centralized identity management",
    "Security Risk": "Without centralized management, inconsistencies in access policies may occur, leading to unauthorized access or inefficient user management.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires configuration of AWS IAM Identity Center and integration with external identity providers. Not enabled by default.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS IAM Identity Center setup, manage policies via AWS IAM, and validate synchronization with AWS Config.",
