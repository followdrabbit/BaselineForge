    "Title": "Enforce TLS 1.2 or Later with PFS for AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Description": "Configure network settings to ensure connections to AWS Application Migration Service use TLS 1.2 or later with cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as DHE or ECDHE.",
    "Applicability": "All network clients accessing AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Using protocols or cipher suites that do not support PFS can lead to potential breaches where past communications could be decrypted if the server's private key is compromised.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "TLS 1.2 and later supporting PFS is typically supported by modern systems; however, it must be enforced in client configurations.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required to ensure network policy enforcement as AWS does not control client-side configurations.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/infrastructure-security.html"

    "Title": "Sign All Requests Using AWS STS or IAM Credentials",
    "Description": "Ensure all requests to AWS Application Migration Service are signed using AWS Security Token Service (STS) or credentials associated with an IAM principal.",
    "Applicability": "All requests to AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Unsigned requests could lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or unauthorized modifications.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS services automatically require signed API requests.",
    "Automation": "Enforced by AWS SDKs and AWS CLI, which automatically sign API requests using AWS credentials.",

    "Title": "Automate Access Key Deletion after AWS Replication Agent Installation",
    "Description": "Use IAM permission boundaries and aws:CurrentTime global context key to automate the expiration and deletion of AWS access keys after AWS Replication Agent installation and migration completion.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Application Migration Service installations",
    "Security Risk": "Residual access keys not deleted could be misused, leading to unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Keys are deleted from source servers upon disconnection but customer action is required for any remaining keys.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using IAM policies with time-based conditions.",

  {
    "Title": "Use Amazon EBS Encryption for Data Security",
    "Description": "Enable Amazon EBS encryption for all EBS volumes used by AWS Application Migration Service to ensure data is protected at rest.",
    "Applicability": "All EBS volumes used by AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Unencrypted data at rest can be accessed if compromised, leading to information exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Amazon EBS encryption is not enabled by default.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `ebs-encrypted-volumes`.",

    "Applicability": "Replication servers in AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Servers exposed to the public internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Default security group settings may allow broader access than intended; proper configuration is essential.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Security Hub and AWS Config to check security group configurations.",

    "Title": "Ensure 'aws-replication' User Has Necessary Permissions",
    "Description": "The 'aws-replication' user on the Linux source server must have permissions to read and write to block devices necessary for AWS Application Migration Service operations.",
    "Applicability": "Linux source servers within AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Insufficient permissions may disrupt migration operations, leading to data integrity issues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS creates the 'aws-replication' user but configuring permissions must be performed manually.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required to set the correct permissions.",
