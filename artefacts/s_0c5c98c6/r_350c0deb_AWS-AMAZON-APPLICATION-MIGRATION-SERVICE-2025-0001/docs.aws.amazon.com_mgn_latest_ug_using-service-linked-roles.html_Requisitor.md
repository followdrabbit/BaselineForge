Here's a structured extraction of security requirements that can be converted into automated security controls from the provided AWS Application Migration Service documentation:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "AWS Application Migration Service automatically creates a service-linked role AWSServiceRoleForApplicationMigrationService when configuring the Replication Configuration Template.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Creating a service-linked role for AWS Application Migration Service' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "The role is automatically created and managed by AWS, eliminating the need for manual role creation."
  },
  {
    "Description": "AWS Application Migration Service does not allow editing the AWSServiceRoleForApplicationMigrationService service-linked role's name after creation.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Editing a service-linked role for AWS Application Migration Service' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "While the name cannot be changed, the description can be edited."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Permissions required for AWSServiceRoleForApplicationMigrationService include actions across services such as EC2, IAM, KMS, and Organizations.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Service-linked role permissions for AWS Application Migration Service' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "The role assumes trust for 'mgn.amazonaws.com' and includes multiple permissions related to AWS resources."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Deletion of AWSServiceRoleForApplicationMigrationService must be done after all associated AWS resources are cleaned up to ensure permissions are not inadvertently removed.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Deleting a service-linked role for AWS Application Migration Service' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Resources like waves, applications, source servers, and jobs must be deleted across all AWS regions before role deletion."
  },
  {
    "Description": "AWSServiceRoleForApplicationMigrationService role permissions policy allows EC2 actions such as StartInstances, StopInstances, and TerminateInstances except when the resource tag `AWSApplicationMigrationServiceManaged` is true.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Service-linked role permissions for AWS Application Migration Service' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Certain permissions are conditional based on resource tags."
  },
  {
    "Description": "AWSServiceRoleForApplicationMigrationService includes EC2 permissions to create resources such as volumes and security groups, conditional on the request tags.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Service-linked role permissions for AWS Application Migration Service' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Resource management actions are conditioned on request tags to prevent unintended actions."

```

This JSON output identifies the key requirements from the AWS Application Migration Service documentation that can be automated, including creating, managing, and deleting the service-linked roles and specific IAM permissions.
