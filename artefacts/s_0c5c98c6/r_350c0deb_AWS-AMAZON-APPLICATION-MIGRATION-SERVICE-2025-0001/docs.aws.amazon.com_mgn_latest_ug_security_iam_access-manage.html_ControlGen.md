    "Title": "Create and Attach Necessary IAM Policies",
    "Description": "Ensure that IAM policies are created and appropriately attached to users, roles, or groups to grant necessary permissions for executing actions on AWS resources.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without properly assigned IAM permissions, users or roles may not have the necessary permissions to perform required operations, leading to operational inefficiencies or potential security risks.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS accounts and roles have no permissions by default; explicit policies need to be defined and attached.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated using AWS IAM and CloudFormation templates to ensure policies are created and managed centrally.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html"
    ]
  },
  {
    "Title": "Implement Identity-based Policies",
    "Description": "Use identity-based policies in JSON format to grant permissions directly to AWS identities such as users, roles, or groups, distinguishing between inline and managed policies for optimal flexibility.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Improperly configured identity-based policies can result in either excessive permissions or lack of necessary access, undermining security principles.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Policies must be defined; no default permissions are granted.",
    "Automation": "Can be managed through AWS IAM using CloudFormation or the AWS CLI for consistent policy application.",

    "Title": "Deploy Resource-based Policies",
    "Description": "Ensure that resource-based policies are configured and attached to AWS resources to explicitly denote which principals have access, overcoming cross-account access challenges.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS resources supporting resource-based policies",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of resource-based policies can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, especially in cross-account scenarios.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Resource-based policies must be explicitly defined on supported resources for access management.",
    "Automation": "Can be handled using AWS CloudFormation templates or the AWS CLI to define and deploy resource-based policies.",

  {
    "Title": "Define Permissions Boundaries",
    "Description": "Set permissions boundaries to restrict the maximum permissions an identity-based policy can grant, limiting access in a controlled manner.",
    "Applicability": "All identities within AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without boundaries, there's potential risk of inadvertently granting excessive permissions, which could be exploited by malicious actors.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Permissions boundaries must be explicitly defined; they do not override existing policies but act as a limiting layer.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS IAM to define and manage permissions boundaries through the Console or AWS CLI.",

    "Title": "Apply Service Control Policies (SCPs)",
    "Description": "Implement SCPs across AWS Organizations to limit the maximum allowable permissions for member accounts or organizational units.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Organization member accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without SCPs, organizational units might exceed their intended permissions, leading to potential security vulnerabilities across multiple accounts.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "SCPs must be explicitly configured within AWS Organizations.",
    "Automation": "Manage SCPs using AWS Organizations Console or through AWS CLI for enforcing organization-wide policies.",

  {
    "Title": "Limit Permissions with Resource Control Policies (RCPs)",
    "Description": "Configure RCPs to restrict permissions across AWS resources, including those outside of organizational boundaries, maintaining stringent access control.",
    "Applicability": "Applicable to cross-account or external resource access",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of RCPs can result in unauthorized cross-account access that might not align with organizational security practices.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "RCPs require explicit definition; they are not innate within AWS two-account communications.",
    "Automation": "Manage RCPs using AWS IAM policies and cross-account resource sharing setups.",

      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-control-access.html"

  {
    "Title": "Manage Session Policies for Temporary Access",
    "Description": "Utilize session policies to define permissions for temporary sessions during role assumption or federation, ensuring proper intersection with existing policies.",
    "Applicability": "Roles and federated identities using temporary credentials",
    "Security Risk": "Without controls on session policies, temporary access can lead to permission slip-ups either providing excessive access or lacking needed permissions.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Session policies have to be purposely defined and used.",
    "Automation": "Session policies can be configured and enforced via AWS STS operations when defining temporary credential parameters.",
