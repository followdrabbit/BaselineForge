Below is a JSON-formatted output of extracted automatable security requirements based on the provided Markdown documentation:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "By default, users and roles have no permissions. IAM administrators must create IAM policies to grant permissions to perform actions on resources.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Managing access using policies' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure IAM policies are created and attached to grant necessary permissions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Identity-based policies define permissions through JSON documents attached to identities, such as users, roles, or groups.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Identity-based policies' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "Distinguish between inline policies and managed policies for flexible access control management."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Resource-based policies control access to resources by attaching JSON policy documents to the resources themselves.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Resource-based policies' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure principals are specified in resource-based policies."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Define permissions boundaries to set the maximum permissions an identity-based policy can grant.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Other policy types' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "Permissions boundaries intersect with other policies to define the final permissions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Service control policies (SCPs) limit the maximum permissions for AWS organizations or organizational units.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Other policy types' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "Apply SCPs to manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts within an organization."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Resource control policies (RCPs) can limit permissions for resources across accounts without altering IAM policies.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Other policy types' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "RCPs affect permissions even for resources not within an organization."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Session policies can be passed as parameters to define permissions for temporary sessions with roles or federated users.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Other policy types' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security_iam_access-manage.html",
    "Observations": "Session policies intersect with resource-based policies and identity-based policies for session security."
