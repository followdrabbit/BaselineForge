    "Title": "Restrict Access to Replication Servers to Source CIDR Range",
    "Description": "Configure security groups for replication servers to allow inbound traffic only from the specified source servers' CIDR range. This can be achieved by adding ingress rules to the security group associated with the replication servers, specifying the exact CIDR range allowed.",
    "Applicability": "Replication servers within AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "If access is not restricted to specific CIDR ranges, unauthorized users could exploit open network paths to compromise system integrity and data confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS security groups do not restrict CIDR ranges by default; customization is needed.",
    "Automation": "Enforceable through AWS Config rule `custom-inbound-sg-rule` to ensure only specific CIDR ranges are allowed.",

    "Title": "Restrict Open Ports Post-Migration",
    "Description": "Configure security groups and Network ACLs for migrated servers to allow only necessary ports. This involves reviewing and setting egress and ingress rules to deny all entries except those explicitly required for application functionality.",
    "Applicability": "Post-migration server environments",
    "Security Risk": "Exposing unnecessary ports can lead to potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, risking system availability and data integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS security groups do not restrict ports by default; manual configuration is required.",
    "Automation": "Utilize AWS Config rules such as `restricted-common-port` to ensure compliance with open port policies.",

    "Title": "Automate OS and Software Package Patching",
    "Description": "Utilize AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate the patching of OS and software packages. This ensures that all systems are regularly updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
    "Applicability": "All servers managed within AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Unpatched systems may be vulnerable to exploit and attack, risking data theft or system compromise.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Patching is not automated by default and requires configuration of AWS Systems Manager.",

    "Title": "Verify and Enforce Minimal Running Services",
    "Description": "Using AWS Config rules or custom scripts, ensure that only necessary OS/application services are enabled post-migration.",
    "Applicability": "All instances post-migration",
    "Security Risk": "Running unnecessary services increases the attack surface and resource utilization, potentially compromising security and performance.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not provide built-in verification of running services, custom implementation required.",
    "Automation": "AWS Config custom rules can assist in auditing running services and enforcing compliance.",

    "Applicability": "All critical resources within AWS Application Migration Service",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of protection exposes resources to denial of service attacks, impacting availability and service continuity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS Shield Standard is enabled by default, but AWS Shield Advanced requires manual activation and setup.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required for AWS Shield Advanced setup. Monitor through AWS Shield dashboard.",

    "Description": "Ensure all IAM policies are structured using 'Effect', 'Action', 'Resource', and optionally 'Condition' to define precise permissions and limitations on actions.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM policies in the AWS account",
    "Security Risk": "Improperly structured policies may lead to over-permissive access, risking data breaches and unauthorized actions.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not enforce a specific structure beyond syntactical correctness.",

    "Security Risk": "Without CloudTrail logging, unauthorized activities may go unnoticed, complicating incident response and forensics.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail is not enabled by default for all regions; setup is required.",
    "Automation": "Automated setup through AWS CloudFormation or manual configuration. AWS Config rule `cloudtrail-enabled-and-logging` can monitor compliance.",
