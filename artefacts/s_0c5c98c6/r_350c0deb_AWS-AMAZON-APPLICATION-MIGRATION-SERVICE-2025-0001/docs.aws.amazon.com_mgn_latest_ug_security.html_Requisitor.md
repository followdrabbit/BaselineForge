Here's an analysis of the documentation for the AWS Application Migration Service, extracting requirements suitable for the creation of automated security controls:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Access to replication servers should be allowed only from source servers CIDR range by applying proper security group rules on replication servers.",
    "Reference": "Security in AWS Application Migration Service - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure security groups are configured correctly to restrict access."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Only allowed ports should be exposed to the public internet after migration.",
    "Reference": "Security in AWS Application Migration Service - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Implement Network ACLs or Security Groups to restrict open ports post-migration."
  },
  {
    "Description": "OS packages and other software deployed on servers should be up to date and free of known vulnerabilities.",
    "Reference": "Security in AWS Application Migration Service - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Leverage AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate patching processes."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Only necessary OS/application services should be up and running.",
    "Reference": "Security in AWS Application Migration Service - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Use AWS Config rules or custom scripts to verify and enforce running services compliance."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Enable Anti-DDoS protection (AWS Shield) in the AWS account to protect replication and migrated servers from denial of service attacks.",
    "Reference": "Security in AWS Application Migration Service - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Check the application of AWS Shield on critical resources."
  },
  {
    "Description": "IAM policies should use 'Effect', 'Action', 'Resource', and optionally 'Condition' to manage permissions.",
    "Reference": "Policy structure - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure IAM policies follow the stated structure to define permissions correctly."
  },
  {
    "Description": "AWS Application Migration Service must be logged with AWS CloudTrail.",
    "Reference": "Logging AWS Application Migration Service with AWS CloudTrail - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/security.html",
    "Observations": "Verify CloudTrail is enabled and properly configured to log all activities."
  }
]
```

These requirements are extracted for automation in configuring and monitoring the AWS Application Migration Service to enhance its security posture.
