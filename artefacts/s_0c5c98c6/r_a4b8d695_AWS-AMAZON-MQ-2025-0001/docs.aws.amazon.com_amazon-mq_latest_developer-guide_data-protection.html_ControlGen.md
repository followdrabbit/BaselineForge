    "Title": "Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on AWS Accounts",
    "Description": "Configure AWS IAM policies to mandate MFA for all user logins across AWS accounts. Use AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) or IAM policies with AWS Config rules, such as 'iam-user-mfa-enabled', to ensure MFA is enabled.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS IAM does not enforce MFA by default; it must be configured by the user.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS IAM policies and monitored via AWS Config with 'iam-user-mfa-enabled'.",

    "Applicability": "All services communicating with Amazon MQ",
    "Security Risk": "Unencrypted communications can lead to data interception and unauthorized data access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "TLS 1.2 is required; TLS 1.3 is recommended but may require additional configuration.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without detailed logging, it is difficult to detect unauthorized activities or troubleshoot service issues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail is not enabled by default; it must be set up by the user.",

    "Security Risk": "Failure to encrypt data might result in unauthorized data exposure.",

    "Security Risk": "Using PII or sensitive data in names increases risk of accidental exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "This requires adherence to internal guidelines as AWS does not enforce naming conventions.",
