    "Title": "Ensure Amazon MQ Brokers Are Not Publicly Accessible",
    "Risk Description": "Publicly accessible MQ brokers expose the financial institutionâ€™s communication infrastructure to potential unauthorized access and exploitation over the internet, increasing the risk of data breaches, DDoS attacks, and other vulnerabilities.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Public access may lead to interception of sensitive communications and unauthorized access to the message queue.",
      "Integrity": "High - Unauthorized users might inject or alter messages within the MQ broker, affecting the integrity of financial transactions.",
      "Availability": "High - Exposed brokers may fall victim to DDoS attacks, impacting service availability and disrupting banking operations."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failing to restrict public access to MQ brokers may violate LGPD due to inadequate protection of data in transmission and BACEN regulations by not implementing secure access controls, potentially resulting in severe penalties.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Unauthorized accesses might be detectable through logging, but prevention is difficult without proper access controls.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enforce TLS 1.2 or Higher for Amazon MQ Communications",
    "Risk Description": "Without enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher, data in transit may be susceptible to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could compromise sensitive banking information and customer data.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Without TLS, data such as financial records and customer details could be intercepted by attackers.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Lack of encryption could allow attackers to alter messages during transmission.",
      "Availability": "Low - TLS does not directly impact availability but could be used to protect communications in case of service disruption."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with TLS standards can violate PCI DSS, which requires strong cryptography and security protocols for transmitting cardholder data.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Eavesdropping is silent and can go undetected without strict encryption enforcement.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enable AWS CloudTrail Logging for Amazon MQ",
    "Risk Description": "Without CloudTrail logging, unauthorized or malicious actions on Amazon MQ resources may go undetected, leading to security breaches and non-compliance with auditing requirements.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Lack of logging makes it difficult to detect unauthorized access to sensitive operations.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Without logs, identifying and rectifying malicious alterations in data becomes challenging.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Absence of logs could delay responses to incidents impacting availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to implement logging may result in non-compliance with BACEN, LGPD, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS which mandate auditability and traceability of transactions and access.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "High - Without logging, unauthorized activities may go unnoticed, making mitigation post-incident challenging.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Implement Access Control via IAM Policies for Amazon MQ",
    "Risk Description": "Insufficient access control policies could lead to unauthorized actions on MQ resources, potentially resulting in data breaches or accidental data mishandling.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unauthorized individuals could gain access to sensitive messaging data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Unauthorized users might alter or delete messages, impacting transaction integrity.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Unauthorized actions could disrupt MQ services, affecting availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to properly implement IAM might lead to violations of BACEN and LGPD due to inadequate access restriction measures and potential data exposure.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - IAM misconfigurations may not be immediately apparent until exploited.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Ensure Encryption of Amazon MQ Data at Rest Using KMS",
    "Risk Description": "Without encryption, data at rest on Amazon MQ may be accessible to unauthorized entities in the case of a security breach, violating data protection standards.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unencrypted data is vulnerable to exposure in the event of unauthorized access.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - While encryption primarily impacts confidentiality, unauthorized access can still lead to data manipulation.",
      "Availability": "Low - Encryption at rest does not typically impact data availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with LGPD and ISO 27001 encryption requirements for data at rest can result in severe fines and reputation damage.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Detecting unauthorized access to unencrypted data is challenging without proper logging.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Configure VPC Security Groups for Amazon MQ",
    "Risk Description": "Improperly configured security groups can leave MQ brokers vulnerable to unauthorized access through unnecessary open ports, increasing the risk of data breaches and service disruptions.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Open ports increase the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data within MQ brokers.",
      "Integrity": "High - Unauthorized access could lead to data manipulation, affecting transaction integrity.",
      "Availability": "High - Open ports could be exploited for denial-of-service attacks, disrupting MQ operations."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Unrestricted port access may violate BACEN and PCI DSS by not following secure configuration practices, potentially leading to substantial penalties.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Attack vectors via open ports may not be immediately obvious without thorough monitoring.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Utilize Perfect Forward Secrecy with Amazon MQ",
    "Risk Description": "Without Perfect Forward Secrecy, encrypted data captured now can be decrypted retroactively if the server's private key is compromised, endangering long-term confidentiality.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Lack of PFS could lead to future decryptability of sensitive, previously transmitted data.",
      "Integrity": "Low - PFS does not directly impact integrity but protects the confidentiality of transmissions.",
      "Availability": "Low - Does not directly affect availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Lack of PFS could result in non-compliance with higher security standards in PCI DSS and ISO 27001 regarding encryption and data protection.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - The absence of PFS might not be realized until a private key compromise occurs long after data capture.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
