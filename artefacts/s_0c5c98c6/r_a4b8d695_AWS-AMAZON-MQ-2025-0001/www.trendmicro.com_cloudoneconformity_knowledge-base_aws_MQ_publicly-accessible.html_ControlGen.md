    "Title": "Restrict Public Accessibility of Amazon MQ Brokers",
    "Description": "Configure Amazon MQ brokers to prevent public access by setting 'PubliclyAccessible' to 'false'. Ensure all MQ brokers are launched within private subnets of a VPC and are only accessible within that network.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon MQ",
    "Security Risk": "Publicly accessible MQ brokers are exposed to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, XSS, and clickjacking attacks, compromising confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "By default, MQ brokers can be made publicly accessible. This must be explicitly configured to 'false'.",
    "Automation": "This can be monitored using AWS Config. Create AWS Config custom rule to check if MQ brokers are set with 'PubliclyAccessible' as 'false'. Automate using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to set 'PubliclyAccessible' to 'false' by default.",

    "Title": "Audit Amazon MQ Brokers for Public Access Using AWS CLI",
    "Description": "Utilize the AWS CLI command 'describe-broker' to programmatically audit Amazon MQ brokers and verify that 'PubliclyAccessible' is set to 'false'.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon MQ",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to regularly audit can result in unnoticed public exposure of MQ brokers, leading to potential security incidents.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CLI must be available, and sufficient permissions are required to run the 'describe-broker' command.",
    "Automation": "Schedule AWS CLI commands using AWS Lambda or AWS Systems Manager to routinely check 'PubliclyAccessible' status.",

    "Title": "Enforce Private Access Configuration for Amazon MQ Brokers Using AWS CloudFormation",
    "Description": "Deploy Amazon MQ brokers using AWS CloudFormation templates, ensuring that the creation parameter 'PubliclyAccessible' is set to 'false' to restrict public internet access.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts deploying Amazon MQ brokers via AWS CloudFormation",
    "Security Risk": "Misconfiguration during broker creation can inadvertently enable public access, posing a significant risk.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudFormation must be used for MQ broker provisioning to enforce this configuration.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS CloudFormation stacks with templates that set 'PubliclyAccessible' to 'false'. Monitor changes using AWS Config or CloudTrail.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS environments deploying MQ brokers via Terraform",
    "Security Risk": "Allowing public access to MQ brokers can lead to unauthorized data access and integrity issues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Terraform must be used for infrastructure as code implementations regarding MQ broker configurations.",
    "Automation": "Terraform plans can be reviewed and applied through CI/CD pipelines, ensuring 'publicly_accessible' is set to 'false'.",

    "Description": "Script the creation or re-creation of Amazon MQ brokers using AWS CLI with the '--no-publicly-accessible' flag to ensure that brokers are only accessible within a private VPC.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts requiring scripted MQ broker deployments",
    "Security Risk": "Non-private configurations can result in MQ brokers being accessed publicly, leading to security vulnerabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CLI scripts must be correctly configured and executed with proper permissions.",
    "Automation": "Automate using AWS Batch, Lambda, or Systems Manager to execute creation scripts with '--no-publicly-accessible'.",
