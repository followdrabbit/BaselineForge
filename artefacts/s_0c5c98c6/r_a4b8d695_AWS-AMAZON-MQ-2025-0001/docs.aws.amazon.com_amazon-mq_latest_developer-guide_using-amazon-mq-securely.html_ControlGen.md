    "Title": "Disable Public Accessibility for Amazon MQ Brokers",
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon MQ brokers are configured without public accessibility to prevent exposure to the public internet, minimizing the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ brokers",
    "Security Risk": "Publicly accessible brokers are susceptible to DDoS attacks and unauthorized access, compromising the availability and security of the message queues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "By default, brokers can be configured with public accessibility; this must be proactively disabled.",
    "Automation": "Can be audited using AWS Config with a custom rule to check if any brokers are publicly accessible.",

  {
    "Title": "Implement Authorization Maps for Amazon MQ",
    "Description": "Configure authorization maps for all Amazon MQ brokers to manage permissions by group. Ensure that sensitive groups such as 'activemq-webconsole' are properly configured if access to the ActiveMQ Web Console is needed.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ brokers",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper authorization maps, brokers might allow unauthorized users to perform restricted actions, leading to a loss of data integrity and confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "No authorization is configured by default; explicit configuration is required.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation is required to ensure proper authorization map configurations as AWS Config does not natively support this verification.",

  {
    "Title": "Configure VPC Security Groups to Restrict Network Access to Amazon MQ",
    "Description": "VPC Security Groups must be configured to block unnecessary protocols and ports, only allowing access to those actively used by the brokers, thereby minimizing potential attack vectors.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ instances within a VPC",
    "Security Risk": "Leaving unnecessary ports open can expose the broker to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches or interruption in service.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Default VPC Security Groups need to be modified to restrict port access.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rules to ensure that security groups only allow traffic on defined necessary ports.",

  {
    "Title": "Restrict Amazon MQ Broker Access to Specific Ports",
    "Description": "Allow network traffic only on required ports such as AMQP (5671), MQTT (8883), OpenWire (61617), STOMP (61614), and WebSocket (61619) by configuring VPC Security Groups, ensuring that other ports remain closed.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ brokers",
    "Security Risk": "Open ports increase the attack surface for unauthorized access and exploitation, risking data exposure and service availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Security Groups must be explicitly configured for each broker.",
    "Automation": "AWS Config can automate audits of Security Group rules to ensure compliance with the specified port restrictions.",
