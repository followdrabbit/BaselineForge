    "Title": "Ensure Amazon MQ Brokers Are Not Publicly Accessible",
    "Description": "Configure Amazon MQ brokers to prevent public access by setting 'PubliclyAccessible' to 'false'. Ensure all MQ brokers are launched within private subnets of a VPC and are only accessible within that network. Monitor and audit Amazon MQ brokers to verify that they remain non-publicly accessible.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon MQ",
    "Security Risk": "Publicly accessible MQ brokers are exposed to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, and other vulnerabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "By default, brokers can be configured with public accessibility; this must be explicitly set to 'false'.",
    "Automation": "This can be monitored using AWS Config with a custom rule to check if brokers are set with 'PubliclyAccessible' as 'false'. Schedule AWS CLI commands using AWS Lambda or AWS Systems Manager to routinely check 'PubliclyAccessible' status. Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to enforce this setting upon creation.",

    "Title": "Enforce TLS 1.2 or Higher for Amazon MQ Communications",
    "Description": "Configure Amazon MQ to enforce TLS 1.2 or higher for all client communications to ensure secure data transmission. Prefer configurations that support TLS 1.3 for enhanced security.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ client connections",
    "Security Risk": "Data transmitted without TLS 1.2 or higher can be susceptible to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "TLS 1.2 is the minimum accepted version. Manual configuration is required to ensure compliance.",
    "Automation": "Compliance can be audited using AWS Config rules for TLS settings.",

    "Title": "Enable AWS CloudTrail Logging for Amazon MQ",
    "Description": "AWS CloudTrail must be enabled in all regions to log all API requests and operations made on Amazon MQ. Configure CloudTrail to record these activities across all regions for comprehensive logging.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon MQ",
    "Security Risk": "Without CloudTrail logging, unauthorized or unintended actions on Amazon MQ resources may go undetected, leading to potential security breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail does not log by default for all regions; it requires manual configuration.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule 'cloud-trail-enabled'.",

    "Title": "Implement Access Control via IAM Policies for Amazon MQ",
    "Description": "Define and attach IAM policies to restrict access to Amazon MQ resources based on business needs. Only users with explicit permission should perform actions on these resources.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon MQ",
    "Security Risk": "Improper access control can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not automatically create policies; administrators must define and manage them.",
    "Automation": "Setup and management can be audited using AWS IAM Access Analyzer.",

    "Title": "Ensure Encryption of Amazon MQ Data at Rest Using KMS",
    "Description": "Configure Amazon MQ to use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys for encrypting all data at rest to protect sensitive information.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ instances",
    "Security Risk": "Unencrypted data at rest can be vulnerable to unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Data encryption at rest must be explicitly configured to use KMS.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS Config to ensure compliance with encryption standards.",

  {
    "Title": "Configure VPC Security Groups for Amazon MQ",
    "Description": "VPC Security Groups must be configured to block unnecessary protocols and ports, only allowing access to those actively used by the brokers, to minimize potential attack vectors.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ instances within a VPC",
    "Security Risk": "Leaving unnecessary ports open can expose the broker to unauthorized access, leading to potential data breaches or interruption in service.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Default VPC Security Groups need to be modified to restrict port access.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rules to ensure that security groups only allow traffic on necessary ports.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/using-amazon-mq-securely.html"

  {
    "Title": "Utilize Perfect Forward Secrecy with Amazon MQ",
    "Description": "Configure Amazon MQ to use and prefer cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), such as DHE or ECDHE, to maintain confidentiality of communications even if the server's private key is compromised.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon MQ client connections",
    "Security Risk": "Without PFS, intercepted data can be decrypted retroactively if the server's private key is compromised, jeopardizing confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Selection of cipher suites is configured through the client and server settings. Ensure compatibility with Java 7 or later.",
    "Automation": "Manual configuration on the client and server sides is required. AWS Config cannot enforce this setting.",
