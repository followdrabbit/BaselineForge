    "Title": "Run Amazon Aurora DB Cluster in a VPC",
    "Description": "Ensure all Amazon Aurora DB clusters are deployed within an Amazon VPC to utilize its network isolation and access control capabilities. Configure the VPC subnet to ensure proper access and isolation.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon Aurora",
    "Security Risk": "Without VPC isolation, the Aurora DB cluster could be exposed to unauthorized network access, increasing the risk of data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Launching Aurora DB clusters in a VPC is standard, but correct VPC configuration is essential for best security practices.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced and audited via AWS Config rules and AWS CloudFormation templates for VPC setup.",

    "Description": "Configure IAM policies to define permissions for creating, describing, modifying, and deleting Amazon Aurora DB clusters, ensuring least privilege is followed.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts managing Amazon Aurora resources",
    "Security Risk": "Improper IAM configuration can lead to unauthorized access or modification of Aurora resources, potentially compromising data integrity and availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not enforce policies by default; they need explicit definition and assignment.",
    "Automation": "IAM policies can be managed through AWS IAM, and compliance can be monitored via AWS Config with IAM access analyzer.",

    "Description": "Configure security groups to allow only specific IP addresses or EC2 instances to access Amazon Aurora DB clusters, acting as a firewall.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Aurora DB clusters within a VPC",
    "Security Risk": "Without defined security groups, unauthorized external entities might gain access, exposing sensitive data.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Security groups are customizable to enforce access rules; default rules allow no inbound traffic.",
    "Automation": "Managed through AWS EC2 Console, and security group changes can be tracked via AWS CloudTrail.",

    "Applicability": "Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL deployments",
    "Security Risk": "Without encryption, data in transit could be intercepted, leading to data leaks and compromised confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Client-side configuration is required for enforcing encrypted connections.",
    "Automation": "SSL/TLS can be enforced by database configuration parameters, but client applications must also be configured to only use SSL/TLS.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Amazon Aurora",
    "Security Risk": "Without encryption, data at rest is vulnerable to unauthorized access or exposure in case of data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Encryption must be enabled at the time of DB cluster creation; it cannot be applied retroactively to an existing cluster.",
    "Automation": "Configuration can be automated and audited using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Config to ensure encryption settings are active.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Aurora DB clusters",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to configure proper database-level security can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires database administrator to configure and manage database-specific security settings.",
    "Automation": "Settings are configured within the database engine; manual validation required to ensure compliance with organizational security policies.",
