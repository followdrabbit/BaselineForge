    "Title": "Manage KMS Key Permissions for Amazon Aurora",
    "Description": "Ensure key policies or IAM policies grant permissions 'kms:CreateGrant' and 'kms:DescribeKey' with restrictions using 'kms:ViaService' condition key for service `rds.<region>.amazonaws.com` ensuring that encrypted DB clusters in Amazon Aurora are properly secured, minimizing potential abuse of KMS key permissions.",
    "Applicability": "AWS KMS keys used for encrypting Amazon Aurora DB clusters",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper key management, unauthorized users might perform operations with KMS keys, leading to unauthorized decryption and data exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Users must explicitly define key policies or IAM policies; not configured by default.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS IAM policy conditions with AWS Config rule to verify policies include 'kms:ViaService'.",

    "Title": "Log KMS Key Operations in Amazon Aurora Using AWS CloudTrail",
    "Description": "Configure AWS CloudTrail to capture and log all cryptographic operations involving AWS KMS keys used by Amazon Aurora. Ensure logs include detailed encryption context metadata to provide transparency in key usage.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using KMS with Amazon Aurora",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of log transparency can result in undetected unauthorized key usage, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CloudTrail logging must be manually configured and is not enabled by default for detailed encryption context metadata.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS Config to verify CloudTrail is logging KMS key operations with full encryption context.",

    "Title": "Enforce Encryption Context in KMS Operations for Amazon Aurora",
    "Description": "Ensure that all KMS encryption operations involving Amazon Aurora DB clusters include DB cluster ID and EBS volume ID in the encryption context, maintaining consistent application and avoiding operational failures.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon Aurora DB clusters using KMS encryption",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to include consistent encryption contexts can lead to operational errors and affect data integrity during encryption and decryption processes.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "The encryption context needs to be explicitly configured for consistency; AWS does not enforce by default.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required as AWS does not provide automated checks for encryption context consistency.",
