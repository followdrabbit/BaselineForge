# Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster

You can use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) from
your application to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster running Aurora MySQL
or Aurora PostgreSQL.

SSL/TLS connections provide a layer of security by encrypting data that moves
between your client and DB cluster. Optionally, your SSL/TLS connection can
perform server identity verification by validating the server certificate
installed on your database. To require server identity verification, follow
this general process:

  1. Choose the **certificate authority (CA)** that signs the **DB server certificate,** for your database. For more information about certificate authorities, see Certificate authorities.

  2. Download a certificate bundle to use when you are connecting to the database. To download a certificate bundle, see Certificate bundles by AWS Region.

###### Note

All certificates are only available for download using SSL/TLS connections.

  3. Connect to the database using your DB engine's process for implementing SSL/TLS connections. Each DB engine has its own process for implementing SSL/TLS. To learn how to implement SSL/TLS for your database, follow the link that corresponds to your DB engine:

     * [Security with Amazon Aurora MySQL](./AuroraMySQL.Security.html)

     * [Security with Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](./AuroraPostgreSQL.Security.html)

## Certificate authorities

The **certificate authority (CA)** is the certificate that identifies the root
CA at the top of the certificate chain. The CA signs the **DB server
certificate,** which is installed on each DB instance. The DB server
certificate identifies the DB instance as a trusted server.

![Certificate authority
overview](/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/certificate-
authority-overview.png)

Amazon RDS provides the following CAs to sign the DB server certificate for a
database.

Certificate authority (CA) | Description | Common name (CN)  
---|---|---  
rds-ca-rsa2048-g1 |  Uses a certificate authority with RSA 2048 private key algorithm and SHA256 signing algorithm in most AWS Regions. In the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, this CA uses a certificate authority with RSA 2048 private key algorithm and SHA384 signing algorithm. This CA supports automatic server certificate rotation. | Amazon RDS `region-identifier` RSA2048 G1  
rds-ca-rsa4096-g1 |  Uses a certificate authority with RSA 4096 private key algorithm and SHA384 signing algorithm. This CA supports automatic server certificate rotation.  | Amazon RDS `region-identifier` RSA4096 G1  
rds-ca-ecc384-g1 |  Uses a certificate authority with ECC 384 private key algorithm and SHA384 signing algorithm. This CA supports automatic server certificate rotation.  | Amazon RDS `region-identifier` ECC384 G1  
  
###### Note

If you are using the AWS CLI, you can see the validities of the certificate
authorities listed above by using [describe-
certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-
certificates.html).

These CA certificates are included in the regional and global certificate
bundle. When you use the rds-ca-rsa2048-g1, rds-ca-rsa4096-g1, or rds-ca-
ecc384-g1 CA with a database, RDS manages the DB server certificate on the
database. RDS rotates the DB server certificate automatically before it
expires.

### Setting the CA for your database

You can set the CA for a database when you perform the following tasks:

  * Create an Aurora DB cluster â You can set the CA for a DB instance in an Aurora cluster when you create the first DB instance in the DB cluster using the AWS CLI or RDS API. Currently, you can't set the CA for the DB instances in a DB cluster when you create the DB cluster using the RDS console. For instructions, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](./Aurora.CreateInstance.html).

  * Modify a DB instance â You can set the CA for a DB instance in a DB cluster by modifying it. For instructions, see [Modifying a DB instance in a DB cluster](./Aurora.Modifying.html#Aurora.Modifying.Instance).

###### Note

The default CA is set to rds-ca-rsa2048-g1.  You can override the default CA
for your AWS account by using the [modify-
certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-
certificates.html) command.

The available CAs depend on the DB engine and DB engine version. When you use
the AWS Management Console, you can choose the CA using the **Certificate
authority** setting, as shown in the following image.

![Certificate authority
option](/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/certificate-
authority.png)

The console only shows the CAs that are available for the DB engine and DB
engine version. If you're using the AWS CLI, you can set the CA for a DB
instance using the [create-db-
instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-
instance.html) or [modify-db-
instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-
instance.html) command.

If you're using the AWS CLI, you can see the available CAs for your account by
using the [describe-
certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-
certificates.html) command. This command also shows the expiration date for
each CA in `ValidTill` in the output. You can find the CAs that are available
for a specific DB engine and DB engine version using the [describe-db-engine-
versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-
engine-versions.html) command.

The following example shows the CAs available for the default RDS for
PostgreSQL DB engine version.

    
    
    aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine postgres

Your output is similar to the following. The available CAs are listed in
`SupportedCACertificateIdentifiers`. The output also shows whether the DB
engine version supports rotating the certificate without restart in
`SupportsCertificateRotationWithoutRestart`.

    
    
    {
        "DBEngineVersions": [
            {
                "Engine": "postgres",
                "MajorEngineVersion": "13",
                "EngineVersion": "13.4",
                "DBParameterGroupFamily": "postgres13",
                "DBEngineDescription": "PostgreSQL",
                "DBEngineVersionDescription": "PostgreSQL 13.4-R1",
                "ValidUpgradeTarget": [],
                "SupportsLogExportsToCloudwatchLogs": false,
                "SupportsReadReplica": true,
                "SupportedFeatureNames": [
                    "Lambda"
                ],
                "Status": "available",
                "SupportsParallelQuery": false,
                "SupportsGlobalDatabases": false,
                "SupportsBabelfish": false,
                "SupportsCertificateRotationWithoutRestart": true,
                "SupportedCACertificateIdentifiers": [
                    "rds-ca-rsa2048-g1",
                    "rds-ca-ecc384-g1",
                    "rds-ca-rsa4096-g1"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

### DB server certificate validities

The validity of DB server certificate depends on the DB engine and DB engine
version. If the DB engine version supports rotating the certificate without
restart, the validity of the DB server certificate is 1 year. Otherwise the
validity is 3 years.

For more information about DB server certificate rotation, see [Automatic
server certificate rotation](./UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-
rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-server-cert-rotation).

### Viewing the CA for your DB instance

You can view the details about the CA for a database by viewing the
**Connectivity & security** tab in the console, as in the following image.

![Certificate authority
details](/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/certificate-
authority-details.png)

If you're using the AWS CLI, you can view the details about the CA for a DB
instance by using the [describe-db-
instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-
instances.html) command.

##  Download certificate bundles for Aurora

When you connect to your database with SSL or TLS, the database instance
requires a trust certificate from Amazon RDS. Select the appropriate link in
the following table to download the bundle that corresponds with the AWS
Region where you host your database.

### Certificate bundles by AWS Region

The certificate bundles for all AWS Regions and GovCloud (US) Regions contain
the following root CA certificates:

  * `rds-ca-rsa2048-g1`

  * `rds-ca-rsa4096-g1`

  * `rds-ca-ecc384-g1`

The `rds-ca-rsa4096-g1` and `rds-ca-ecc384-g1` certificates are not available
in the following Regions:

  * Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

  * Asia Pacific (Melbourne)

  * Canada West (Calgary)

  * Europe (Zurich)

  * Europe (Spain)

  * Israel (Tel Aviv)

Your application trust store only needs to register the root CA certificate.

###### Note

Amazon RDS Proxy and Aurora Serverless v1 use certificates from the AWS
Certificate Manager (ACM). If you're using RDS Proxy, you don't need to
download Amazon RDS certificates or update applications that use RDS Proxy
connections. For more information, see [Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy](./rds-
proxy.howitworks.html#rds-proxy-security.tls).

If you're using Aurora Serverless v1, downloading Amazon RDS certificates
isn't required. For more information, see [Using TLS/SSL with Aurora
Serverless v1](./aurora-serverless.html#aurora-serverless.tls).

To download a certificate bundle for an AWS Region, select the link for the
