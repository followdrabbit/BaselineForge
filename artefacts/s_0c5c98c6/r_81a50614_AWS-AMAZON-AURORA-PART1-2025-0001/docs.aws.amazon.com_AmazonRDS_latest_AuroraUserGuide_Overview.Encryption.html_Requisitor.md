To extract technical and operational requirements from the provided Amazon Aurora security documentation, we focus on capturing details that can be automated or configured within AWS. Below is a structured JSON output that outlines the specific requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon Aurora DB clusters are encrypted using AES-256 encryption.",
    "Reference": "Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "Encryption applies to the data at rest including automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys for decrypting Amazon Aurora resources.",
    "Reference": "Overview of encrypting Amazon Aurora resources - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "Both AWS managed keys and customer managed keys can be used. Once a DB instance is encrypted, the KMS key cannot be changed."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Enable encryption for a new DB cluster on the AWS console or by setting the --storage-encrypted parameter to true via AWS CLI.",
    "Reference": "Encrypting an Amazon Aurora DB cluster section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "Encryption settings cannot be modified post creation of the encrypted DB cluster."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Verify whether encryption at rest is enabled for Amazon Aurora DB clusters using AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API.",
    "Reference": "Determining whether encryption is turned on for a DB cluster section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "Console checks can be performed under the Configuration tab, while CLI checks use describe-db-clusters with the relevant DB cluster identifier."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use envelope encryption to protect data during cross-region snapshot copies. You must specify a KMS key in the destination AWS Region.",
    "Reference": "Limitations of Amazon Aurora encrypted DB clusters section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "KMS keys are specific to the AWS Region they are created in, and cannot be reused across different regions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Automatic encryption for cross-region data traffic is provided at the physical layer via AWS global network and between AZs.",
    "Reference": "Encryption in transit section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "All traffic is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves AWS secured facilities."
  },
  {
    "Description": "When using cross-account KMS keys, ensure the key is shared with the necessary account during operations like snapshot copying.",
    "Reference": "Overview of encrypting Amazon Aurora resources section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html",
    "Observations": "Revoking key access post-creation does not affect the cluster, but disabling the key will impact all associated clusters."
  }
]
```

This JSON output captures actionable security configuration items from the documentation, focusing on encryption aspects which are critical to securing Amazon Aurora DB clusters. Each entry specifies a requirement, the source in the document where the information is found, and any additional observations pertinent to implementing or verifying the control.
