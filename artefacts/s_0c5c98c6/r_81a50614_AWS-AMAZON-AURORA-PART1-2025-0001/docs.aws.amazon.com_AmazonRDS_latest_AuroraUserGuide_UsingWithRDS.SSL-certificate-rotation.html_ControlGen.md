    "Description": "Ensure RDS DB instances update their CA certificates from 'rds-ca-2019' to 'rds-ca-rsa2048-g1', 'rds-ca-rsa4096-g1', or 'rds-ca-ecc384-g1' using the AWS CLI.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS DB instances with 'rds-ca-2019' certificate",
    "Security Risk": "Expired CA certificates can lead to service disruptions and unsafe connections, impacting data confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not automatically update CA certificates; manual intervention is required.",
    "Automation": "Automate using AWS CLI command `modify-db-instance` with `--ca-certificate-identifier`. Schedule updates using Amazon CloudWatch Events if applying in maintenance windows.",

    "Applicability": "All RDS DB instances undergoing CA certificate updates",
    "Security Risk": "Restarting DB instances during certificate updates can cause downtime resulting in service unavailability and operational impact.",

    "Title": "Automate CA Certificate Update Application",
    "Description": "Use `modify-db-instance` command with `--ca-certificate-identifier` and optionally `--apply-immediately`, to apply certificate updates as needed or scheduled.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS DB instances needing CA certificate updates",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect or delayed application of updates may result in expired certificates, leading to potential data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Manual confirmation is necessary to adjust the application within or outside the maintenance window.",

    "Security Risk": "Failure to update client-side trust stores could lead to application downtime or data access interruptions.",

    "Security Risk": "Manual rotations can be error-prone and lead to expired certificates causing service disruption.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Not all DB engines support automatic rotation; verify compatibility.",
    "Automation": "Monitor and enforce enablement through AWS Config and notify using AWS SNS if not supported by the engine.",
