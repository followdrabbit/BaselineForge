Based on the Amazon RDS documentation provided, here is the extraction of the technical and operational requirements that can be translated into automated security controls:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "RDS DB instances must update their CA certificate from 'rds-ca-2019' to 'rds-ca-rsa2048-g1', 'rds-ca-rsa4096-g1', or 'rds-ca-ecc384-g1' as the old certificate expired in August 2024.",
    "Reference": "[Rotating your SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#rotating-your-ssl-tls-certificate)",
    "Observations": "Ensure the update is applied without impacting the applications by updating the client-side trust store."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Before modifying DB instances to update the CA certificate, confirm if a restart is required using the 'describe-db-engine-versions' command and checking the 'SupportsCertificateRotationWithoutRestart' flag.",
    "Reference": "[Updating your CA certificate by modifying your DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#updating-your-ca-certificate-by-modifying-your-db-instance)",
    "Observations": "Some DB engines may support certificate rotation without a restart."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use the AWS CLI 'modify-db-instance' command with the '--ca-certificate-identifier' option to change the CA certificate. Use '--apply-immediately' to apply updates immediately if necessary.",
    "Reference": "[AWS CLI for changing CA certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html)",
    "Observations": "This ensures the certificate change is executed as planned and can be scheduled for the next maintenance window or applied immediately if needed."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure client applications are updated to accept new SSL/TLS certificates before scheduling the CA certificate rotation.",
    "Reference": "[Important considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#important-considerations)",
    "Observations": "This step is necessary to avoid any service disruptions during the transition to a new CA certificate."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Utilize the automatic server certificate rotation capability of Amazon RDS if supported by your DB engine, which allows certificate rotation without manual intervention.",
    "Reference": "[Automatic server certificate rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#automatic-server-cert-rotation)",
    "Observations": "Ensure your DB engine supports this feature for seamless certificate rotation."
  }

```

This JSON outlines the necessary operational steps and command usage to manage SSL/TLS certificates on RDS DB instances, highlighting how to automate these processes using AWS services and CLI commands.
