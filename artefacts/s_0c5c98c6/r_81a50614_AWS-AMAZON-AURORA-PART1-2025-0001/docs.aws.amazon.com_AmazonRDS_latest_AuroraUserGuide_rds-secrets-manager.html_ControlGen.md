    "Title": "Automate Password Storage in AWS Secrets Manager for Aurora DB Clusters",
    "Description": "Automatically generate and store the master user password for Aurora DB clusters in AWS Secrets Manager whenever a new cluster is created, modified, or restored from S3.",
    "Applicability": "All Aurora DB clusters",
    "Security Risk": "Without automatic password management in Secrets Manager, passwords might be mismanaged or exposed, leading to unauthorized database access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Aurora does not automatically store passwords in Secrets Manager; this must be configured explicitly.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS CloudFormation or the AWS Management Console to enable Secrets Manager integration for Aurora during cluster creation/modification.",

    "Title": "Encrypt Secrets Using AWS KMS Keys for Aurora",
    "Description": "Ensure that secrets in AWS Secrets Manager are encrypted using either the default AWS KMS key or a customer-managed key when integrated with Aurora.",
    "Applicability": "All Aurora DB clusters integrated with Secrets Manager",
    "Security Risk": "Without encryption, sensitive information like database passwords may be exposed, compromising confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Once the KMS key is set for a secret, it cannot be changed unless the DB cluster is modified.",
    "Automation": "Specify the KMS key during the setup of Secrets Manager integration. Monitor using AWS Key Management Service controls.",

    "Title": "Ensure Necessary Permissions for Secrets Manager Operations with Aurora",
    "Description": "Implement IAM policies that include necessary permissions such as `kms:DescribeKey`, `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`, and `secretsmanager:TagResource` for managing secrets in Secrets Manager with Aurora.",
    "Applicability": "IAM roles/users managing Aurora DB clusters with Secrets Manager",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of proper permissions may block or disrupt the management of database access credentials, affecting availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Permissions need to be explicitly granted, as AWS does not provide them by default.",
    "Automation": "Use IAM policy editor or AWS CloudFormation scripts to provision the required permissions.",

    "Title": "Enforce Secrets Manager Use for Password Management with IAM Policies",
    "Description": "Create IAM policies that enforce Aurora to manage the master user password in AWS Secrets Manager for any DB cluster creation or modification.",
    "Applicability": "All Aurora DB clusters",
    "Security Risk": "By not enforcing Secrets Manager, passwords might be managed insecurely, leading to potential data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Manual setup required; IAM policies must be configured for enforcement.",
    "Automation": "Configure IAM policies using AWS Management Console or AWS CloudFormation with specific condition keys for Aurora integrations.",

    "Applicability": "Aurora DB clusters with Secrets Manager enabled",
    "Security Risk": "Delaying password rotation increases the window of time an exposed password remains a vulnerability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Immediate rotation requires user action via CLI or RDS console.",
    "Automation": "Automate using AWS CLI scripts or AWS Lambda functions triggered by specific events or requests.",

    "Security Risk": "Improper access to secret details can lead to unauthorized secret management and potential exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Specific IAM permissions need to be granted for retrieval and management via AWS CLI/API.",
