Here's a structured extraction of automated security controls from the provided Amazon Aurora documentation on database authentication:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "For PostgreSQL databases, assign the 'rds_iam' role to the user to enable IAM database authentication.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'Database authentication with Amazon Aurora' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure that users are not simultaneously assigned both 'rds_iam' and 'rds_ad' roles to avoid conflicts."
  },
  {
    "Description": "For PostgreSQL databases, assign the 'rds_ad' role to the user for Kerberos authentication.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'Database authentication with Amazon Aurora' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "Kerberos requires a trust relationship with AWS Directory Service."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Do not assign both 'rds_iam' and 'rds_ad' roles to a user in PostgreSQL databases to avoid authentication conflicts.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'Database authentication with Amazon Aurora' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "If 'rds_iam' is assigned, IAM authentication precedes."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Integrate AWS Secrets Manager to manage database passwords securely.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'Password authentication' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "This helps to avoid the use of plain text passwords and enhances security."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use IAM database authentication to avoid password management by using IAM authentication tokens.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'IAM database authentication' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "IAM database authentication availability depends on the DB engine."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Configure Kerberos authentication using AWS Directory Service for centralized user authentication management.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'Kerberos authentication' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "Allows single sign-on capabilities with Active Directory."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Follow best practice by not using the master user directly in applications.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Aurora documentation, section 'Database authentication with Amazon Aurora' - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html",
    "Observations": "Create users with minimal privileges necessary for applications."
  }
]
```

This output includes the most relevant requirements for implementing automated security controls related to database authentication methods in Amazon Aurora, based on the provided documentation.
