Based on the provided AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) security audit guidelines documentation, the following technical and operational requirements have been identified that can be converted into automated security controls:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Monitor the usage of AWS root access keys and remove them if they are not in use. It is recommended to use temporary credentials via AWS IAM Identity Center instead.",
    "Reference": "Review your AWS account credentials section - [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html#root-password)",
    "Observations": "Check if default account practices use root access keys against AWS best practices."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Periodically generate and download an IAM credential report for auditing and remove IAM credentials (passwords, access keys) that have not been used recently.",
    "Reference": "Review your IAM users section - [Getting Credential Reports for your AWS Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html)",
    "Observations": "Ensure credential reporting is automated for timely reviews."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that all IAM users, groups, and roles have only the permissions they need and no additional permissions.",
    "Reference": "Tips for reviewing IAM policies section",
    "Observations": "IAM Policy Simulator can be used for testing permissions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "For IAM users with policies granting permissions to launch Amazon EC2 instances, ensure the iam:PassRole action is restricted to explicitly list the roles they can pass.",
    "Reference": "Tips for reviewing IAM policies section - [IAM roles using pass role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-usingrole-ec2instance.html#roles-usingrole-ec2instance-passrole)",
    "Observations": "Specific role lists should be validated in IAM policies."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Make sure IAM policies do not grant permissions for services that are not in use by the account. Use the IAM GetAccountAuthorizationDetails API to identify AWS managed policies in use.",
    "Reference": "Tips for reviewing IAM policies section - [GetAccountAuthorizationDetails API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccountAuthorizationDetails.html)",
    "Observations": "Regularly review and update policies to reflect the services in active use."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Review and update the metadata documents from SAML Identity Providers to ensure they reflect current business needs.",
    "Reference": "Review your IAM providers for SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) section",
    "Observations": "Keep metadata documents up-to-date to prevent outdated configurations."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure mobile applications do not embed AWS access keys, even if stored encrypted, and use temporary credentials via appropriate APIs like Amazon Cognito.",
    "Reference": "Review Your mobile apps section - [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)",
    "Observations": "Consider automatic scanning of mobile source code for embedded credentials."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Be cautious with IAM permissions that allow users to create IAM roles, groups, or policies since they can grant themselves full permissions. Ensure such capabilities are restricted to trusted identities only.",
    "Reference": "Tips for reviewing IAM policies section",
    "Observations": "Identify and control who has the ability to create or modify IAM roles and policies effectively."
  }
]
```

These structured requirements will help guide the development of automated security controls in AWS environments, ensuring IAM configurations are secure and compliant.
