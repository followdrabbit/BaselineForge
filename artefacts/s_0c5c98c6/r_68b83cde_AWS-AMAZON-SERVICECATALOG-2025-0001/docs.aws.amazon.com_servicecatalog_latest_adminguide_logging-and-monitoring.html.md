# Logging and Monitoring in AWS Service Catalog

AWS Service Catalog integrates with AWS CloudTrail, a service that captures
all of the AWS Service Catalog API calls and delivers the log files to an
Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. For more information, see [Logging AWS
Service Catalog API Calls with
CloudTrail.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/logging-
using-cloudtrail.html)

You can also use notification constraints to set up Amazon SNS notifications
about stack events. For more information, see [AWS Service Catalog
Notification Constraints](./constraints-notification.html).
