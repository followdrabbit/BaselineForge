    "Title": "Grant AWS Service Catalog Administrators Full Access",
    "Description": "IAM roles assigned to AWS Service Catalog administrators must include comprehensive permissions to manage portfolios, products, constraints, and access for end users. This can be achieved by assigning the AWS managed policy 'AWSServiceCatalogAdminFullAccess' to the administrator roles.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts with Service Catalog usage",
    "Security Risk": "Without appropriate permissions, administrators may be unable to manage catalog components effectively, leading to misconfigurations and availability issues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not automatically assign this level of access; it must be explicitly configured.",
    "Automation": "Can be implemented by attaching the 'AWSServiceCatalogAdminFullAccess' managed policy to administrator roles in IAM.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts where end users need Service Catalog access",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect configurations could lead to unauthorized access or inability to use needed resources, affecting productivity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not define end user roles by default; they must be set up according to organizational needs.",

    "Title": "Utilize AWS Managed Policies for Service Catalog IAM Policy Creation",
    "Description": "Administrators should create IAM policies for AWS Service Catalog access control by reviewing AWS managed policies as examples to ensure comprehensive permissions are configured for required roles.",
    "Applicability": "Organizations utilizing AWS Service Catalog",
    "Security Risk": "Poorly configured IAM policies could lead to unauthorized access or limit functionality required by roles, impacting security and efficiency.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS provides managed policies, but custom policies need to be manually tailored based on these examples.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required for custom policy creation, although baseline policies can be derived from AWS managed policies.",
