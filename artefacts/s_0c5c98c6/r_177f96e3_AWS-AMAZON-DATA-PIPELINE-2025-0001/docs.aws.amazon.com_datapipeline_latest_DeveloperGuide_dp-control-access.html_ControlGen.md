    "Title": "Restrict Access to Specific AWS Data Pipelines Using IAM Policies",
    "Description": "Create IAM policies to define which users or groups can access specific AWS Data Pipeline resources. Configure these policies to allow or deny access based on user roles, permissions, or other attributes.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Data Pipeline",
    "Security Risk": "If access is not controlled, unauthorized users may alter or access sensitive data or operations, leading to data exposure and potential security breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM provides the ability to control access, but policies must be explicitly defined and attached.",
    "Automation": "Monitor via AWS Config with custom rules to check for compliance with IAM policies restricting AWS Data Pipeline access.",

    "Title": "Protect Production Pipelines with IAM Role-Based Access",
    "Description": "Assign specific IAM roles with limited permissions to production AWS Data Pipelines to prevent unauthorized edits. Implement policies that enforce these roles are applied to production environments.",
    "Applicability": "Production environments using AWS Data Pipeline",
    "Security Risk": "Unauthorized modifications to production pipelines can lead to service disruptions or data integrity issues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Roles must be clearly defined and managed; AWS does not enforce role definitions automatically.",
    "Automation": "Utilize AWS Config to audit IAM role assignments and compliance in production.",

    "Title": "Enforce Read-Only Access for Auditors on AWS Data Pipeline",
    "Description": "Create IAM policies granting auditors read-only access to all AWS Data Pipeline resources, ensuring they cannot modify or delete any data or configurations.",
    "Applicability": "Auditor roles across all environments",
    "Security Risk": "If auditors can modify resources, it could lead to accidental or malicious changes.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not inherently restrict actions without explicit policy definitions.",
    "Automation": "Compliance can be monitored via AWS Config across all environments for read-only policies.",

    "Title": "Manage AWS Data Pipeline Access with Unique IAM Credentials",
    "Description": "Assign unique IAM credentials to each user and configure appropriate permissions for accessing AWS Data Pipeline services. Leverage policies to manage user access individually.",
    "Applicability": "All users accessing AWS Data Pipeline",
    "Security Risk": "Shared credentials increase the risk of credentials misuse and unauthorized access to resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM provides credential management, but policy and access settings require manual configuration.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS IAM and AWS Config rules to ensure unique credentials and proper policy assignments are in place.",

    "Title": "Utilize Tags and Worker Groups for Access Management in AWS Data Pipeline",
    "Description": "Implement IAM policies that use tags and worker groups to manage the sharing and access levels of AWS Data Pipeline. Configure policies to allow fine-grained access control using tags and worker group identifiers.",
    "Applicability": "Data pipelines using tagging and worker groups",
    "Security Risk": "Without tag-based policies, managing access control becomes complex and error-prone, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Tag-based access control needs to be explicitly configured in IAM policies.",
    "Automation": "AWS Config can monitor and ensure compliance with tag-based IAM policy configurations.",
