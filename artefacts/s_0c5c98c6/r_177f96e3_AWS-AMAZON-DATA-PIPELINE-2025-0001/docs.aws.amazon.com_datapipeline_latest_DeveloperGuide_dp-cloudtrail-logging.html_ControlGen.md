        "Description": "AWS CloudTrail must be enabled and configured to log all AWS Data Pipeline API calls, including console and API operations. This includes enabling CloudTrail in all AWS regions and ensuring that API calls are recorded.",
        "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Data Pipeline",
        "Security Risk": "Without logging API calls, unauthorized changes or access to AWS Data Pipeline resources may go unnoticed, posing risks to data integrity and security.",

        "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Data Pipeline",
        "Security Risk": "Without a centralized logging mechanism, analysis and review of API activities across regions become challenging, hindering incident response and compliance efforts.",
