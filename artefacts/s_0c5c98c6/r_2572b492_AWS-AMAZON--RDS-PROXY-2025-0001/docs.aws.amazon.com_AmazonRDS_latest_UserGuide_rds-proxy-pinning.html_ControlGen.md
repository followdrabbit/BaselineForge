    "Title": "Monitor 'DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned' Metric in AWS CloudWatch",
    "Description": "Configure AWS CloudWatch to monitor the 'DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned' metric for RDS Proxy. Set up alarms to notify administrators when specific thresholds are breached, indicating potential performance issues due to excessive session pinning.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using RDS Proxy",
    "Security Risk": "Without monitoring, excessive session pinning could degrade database performance, affecting application responsiveness and availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CloudWatch provides extensive monitoring capabilities but requires manual configuration of alarms.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated using AWS CloudWatch alarms and dashboards.",

    "Title": "Apply Session Pinning Filters for RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Implement session pinning filters on the RDS Proxy for MySQL database engines to exempt specified operations from causing session pinning. This will allow for optimized connection reuse by avoiding pinning where it is not necessary.",
    "Applicability": "RDS Proxy instances using MySQL engine",
    "Security Risk": "Improper configuration might lead to unintended session pinning, degrading performance by reducing connection pool efficiency.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires careful analysis to ensure compliance with application behavior without impacting functionality.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required; configuration can be deployed using AWS SDKs or AWS CLI.",

    "Title": "Implement Policies to Minimize Unnecessary Database Requests in RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Develop policies and modify application code or workloads to avoid conditions that trigger unnecessary session pinning in RDS Proxy instances. This optimization is crucial for maintaining efficient resource management and application performance.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS Proxy-enabled environments",
    "Security Risk": "Excess session pinning could lead to increased resource consumption and suboptimal application performance.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires development efforts to analyze and modify application logic.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required; changes are typically integrated during development and deployment phases.",

    "Title": "Use 'SET LOCAL' Statement to Avoid Session Pinning for MySQL and MariaDB",
    "Description": "Configure applications using MySQL and MariaDB databases to utilize the 'SET LOCAL' statement for session-specific configurations. This approach prevents session pinning, promoting better connection pool utilization.",
    "Applicability": "RDS Proxy instances with MySQL and MariaDB engines",
    "Security Risk": "Without using 'SET LOCAL', database connections could become pinned, leading to reduced efficiency in handling concurrent database requests.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires application code changes to use 'SET LOCAL'.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required; changes are applied through application development processes.",

    "Title": "Prevent Session Pinning for 'SET' operations with Specific Variables in RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Ensure RDS Proxy does not pin connections when 'SET' statements with 'TRANSACTION_ISOLATION' and 'TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY' variables are executed at the session scope. Application logic should be reviewed to use these variables appropriately.",
    "Applicability": "RDS Proxy instances with MySQL and MariaDB engines",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper configuration, session-level 'SET' operations can lead to unnecessary connection pinning, affecting performance.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires code reviews and adjustments to application logic to implement effectively.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required to analyze and adjust application logic.",

    "Title": "Implement Custom Session Pinning Filters for Complex Applications",
    "Description": "Use custom session pinning filters in RDS Proxy to define specific statements or functions that can bypass pinning behavior. This allows for tailored connection management strategies in complex applications that require specialized session state handling.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS Proxy deployments, specifically complex applications",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect filtering may lead to performance issues or application errors due to inappropriate session state management.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Customization is application-specific and requires careful implementation.",
    "Automation": "Manual configuration and validation are required, with potential for automation through deployment scripts.",
