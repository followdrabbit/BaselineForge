    "Title": "Create IAM Policy for RDS Proxy to Access Secrets Manager",
    "Description": "Define an IAM policy granting RDS Proxy permissions to retrieve and decrypt database credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager. This policy must include 'secretsmanager:GetSecretValue' and 'kms:Decrypt' actions, with conditions tailored to specific Region, account ID, and KMS key ID.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts utilizing RDS Proxy with Secrets Manager",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper permissions, RDS Proxy may fail to access database credentials, leading to service interruptions and potential data exposure if alternative workaround methods are insecure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM policies must be explicitly defined and assigned; AWS does not automatically grant these permissions.",
    "Automation": "Policy can be created and applied using IAM policy management via AWS CLI or IAM console.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-iam-setup.html"

    "Title": "Configure IAM Role with Secrets Manager Access for RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Create and configure an IAM role that includes the policy granting access to secrets in AWS Secrets Manager necessary for RDS Proxy. This role must allow 'rds.amazonaws.com' to assume it.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts employing RDS Proxy with IAM roles",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to correctly configure IAM roles could prevent RDS Proxy from accessing needed secrets, affecting service availability and potentially leading to improper error handling.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires manual IAM role and policy configuration. AWS management tools are needed for setup.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated via AWS CLI using 'aws iam create-role' and 'aws iam put-role-policy'.",

  {
    "Title": "Establish Trust Policy for IAM Role Assumed by RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Ensure the IAM role associated with RDS Proxy has a trust policy allowing 'rds.amazonaws.com' to assume the role. The policy must include 'sts:AssumeRole' with 'rds.amazonaws.com' as the trusted entity.",
    "Applicability": "IAM roles linked to AWS RDS Proxy service",
    "Security Risk": "Without a valid trust policy, RDS Proxy will be unable to assume necessary roles, leading to service disruptions and operational inefficiencies.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Trust policies must be specified during IAM role creation; AWS does not automatically configure these trust relationships.",
    "Automation": "Automated through AWS CLI commands such as 'aws iam update-assume-role-policy'.",
