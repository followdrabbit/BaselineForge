    "Title": "Configure RDS Proxy Idle Client Timeout",
    "Description": "Set the IdleClientTimeout to an appropriate value in the RDS Proxy to manage idle client connections effectively. This setting determines how long RDS Proxy will keep idle client connections open, with the default value being 1,800 seconds (30 minutes). Configure this setting based on workload and connection management policies.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS Proxy configurations",
    "Security Risk": "If not configured properly, it could lead to prolonged inactive connections consuming resources or frequent dropping of connections.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Default value is 1,800 seconds; however, this needs adjustment based on business needs.",
    "Automation": "Configuration can be automated and monitored using AWS CloudFormation or by scripting AWS CLI commands. Monitoring can be done using AWS CloudWatch metrics for connection management.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html"

  {
    "Title": "Set Max Connections Percent in RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Configure the MaxConnectionsPercent to limit the total number of connections RDS Proxy can create to the target database. This percentage is determined based on the max_connections setting of the target RDS database instance and should be set considering the observed peak usage.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS Proxies connected to relational databases",
    "Security Risk": "Over-provisioning may lead to resource exhaustion, and under-provisioning might restrict application performance under load.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires manual configuration; defaults may not align with actual usage patterns.",
    "Automation": "This can be automated using CloudFormation templates or AWS SDKs. Monitoring can be performed through CloudWatch to adjust based on usage metrics.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html"

  {
    "Title": "Configure Max Idle Connections Percent in RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Determine the MaxIdleConnectionsPercent in the RDS Proxy configuration to manage the number of idle connections in the pool. This impacts how the proxy retains unused database connections in anticipation of future spikes in load.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS Proxy configurations",
    "Security Risk": "Improper configuration may lead to inefficient connection pool management, affecting performance during load surges.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Defaults to typical settings; adjust based on application load behaviors.",
    "Automation": "Utilize CloudFormation or automation scripts for initial configuration and CloudWatch for monitoring pool metrics.",

  {
    "Title": "Set RDS Proxy Connection Borrow Timeout",
    "Description": "Configure the ConnectionBorrowTimeout on RDS Proxy to define how long a client waits to obtain a connection from the pool before timing out. Default is 120 seconds, but should be tailored to application requirements.",
    "Applicability": "All applications utilizing RDS Proxy",
    "Security Risk": "Suboptimal timeout values can lead to unnecessary application errors or delays, impacting performance.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Defaults to 120 seconds; configuration necessary to align with application logic.",
    "Automation": "Automate setup using AWS CloudFormation or programmatic AWS CLI configurations. Monitor with CloudWatch metrics for fine-tuning.",

  {
    "Title": "Enforce Max Life of Client Connections in RDS Proxy",
    "Description": "Ensure that RDS Proxy's maximum client connection life does not exceed 24 hours. Align application-side connection pools to have a maximum connection lifespan less than this to prevent unexpected disconnections.",
    "Applicability": "All applications using RDS Proxy",
    "Security Risk": "Misalignment between application-side pooling and proxy limits may result in sporadic connection drops.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "This requires explicit configuration adjustments both in RDS Proxy and application settings.",
    "Automation": "Employ CloudFormation templates or AWS CLI for proxy configuration; application adjustments may need manual intervention.",

  {
    "Title": "Ensure Application Connection Idle Timeout Configurations Are Aligned",
    "Description": "Configure the application-side connection pool to have an idle timeout less than that set in RDS Proxy to prevent dropped connections. This ensures harmonious interaction between application logic and proxy settings.",
    "Applicability": "All applications interfacing with RDS Proxy",
    "Security Risk": "Mismatch in timeout settings may lead to sudden disconnection events, impacting stability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Requires synchronization between application connection settings and RDS Proxy's configured timeouts.",
    "Automation": "RDS side can be automated; application-side configurations may require manual checks and adjustments.",
