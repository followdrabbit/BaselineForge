    "Description": "Ensure that RDS Proxy's maximum client connection life does not exceed 24 hours. Align application-side connection pools to have a maximum connection lifespan less than this to prevent unexpected disconnections.",
    "Applicability": "All applications using RDS Proxy",
    "Security Risk": "Misalignment between application-side pooling and proxy limits may result in sporadic connection drops.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "This requires explicit configuration adjustments both in RDS Proxy and application settings.",
