Here are the extracted technical and operational requirements from the documentation that can be converted into automated security controls:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Set the IdleClientTimeout to an appropriate value to manage idle client connections in RDS Proxy. The default value is 1,800 seconds (30 minutes).",
    "Reference": "IdleClientTimeout section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html",
    "Observations": "Lowering the timeout can help proactively remove stale connections; higher timeouts might save the cost of frequent connection establishments."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Set the MaxConnectionsPercent to limit the number of connections that an RDS Proxy can establish with the target database. The percentage is based on max_connections for the RDS DB instance.",
    "Reference": "MaxConnectionsPercent section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html",
    "Observations": "It is recommended to set this parameter at least 30% above your maximum recent monitored usage to allow headroom for workload changes."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Configure the MaxIdleConnectionsPercent to control the number of idle database connections kept in the pool by RDS Proxy.",
    "Reference": "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html",
    "Observations": "Consider setting a high value if workloads are unpredictable to accommodate activity surges without frequent reconnections."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Set the ConnectionBorrowTimeout for how long RDS Proxy waits for a database connection in the pool before returning a timeout error. The default is 120 seconds.",
    "Reference": "ConnectionBorrowTimeout section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html",
    "Observations": "Use this setting to define the best wait period without altering application query timeouts."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Enforce RDS Proxy's maximum life of client connections to 24 hours. Ensure application-side connection pools have a maximum connection life less than 24 hours.",
    "Reference": "Client connection max life section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html",
    "Observations": "Client-side configurations should avoid unexpected connection drops by aligning with RDS Proxy's enforced limits."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure client connection idle timeout in the application-side connection pool is lower than RDS Proxy's setting to prevent unexpected drops.",
    "Reference": "Client connection idle timeout section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-connections.html",
    "Observations": "RDS Proxy has an enforced maximum idle timeout for client connections, which the application-side pools should respect."
  }
]
```

These extracted requirements focus on configurations for connection management in RDS Proxy, which can be automated and monitored using AWS services such as AWS Config or other monitoring tools.
