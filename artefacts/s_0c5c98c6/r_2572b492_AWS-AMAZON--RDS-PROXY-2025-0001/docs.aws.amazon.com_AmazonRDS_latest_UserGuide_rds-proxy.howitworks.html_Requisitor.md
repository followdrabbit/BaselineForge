Based on the provided documentation, I've extracted technical and operational requirements that can be automated for security controls within AWS, specifically relating to RDS Proxy. Here is the structured JSON output of the identified requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Require Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all connections between RDS Proxy and your database.",
    "Reference": "Section: Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "Configure this setting in AWS Management Console when creating or modifying a proxy."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Store database credentials for RDS DB instances accessed by RDS Proxy in AWS Secrets Manager.",
    "Reference": "Section: RDS Proxy security - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure each database user has a corresponding secret in Secrets Manager."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Enable IAM authentication for users of RDS Proxy to enforce database access security.",
    "Reference": "Section: RDS Proxy security - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "This allows the use of IAM roles even if the database uses native password authentication."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use IAM roles for application connections to RDS Proxy, even if the proxy connects to the database using native authentication.",
    "Reference": "Section: RDS Proxy Security - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "This practice helps enforce strong authentication requirements without requiring changes in DB instances."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use `--ssl-mode` `VERIFY_CA` or `VERIFY_IDENTITY` with the MySQL client to enforce SSL and verify the Certificate Authority (CA).",
    "Reference": "Section: Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "The `--ssl-ca` option with the required CA certificate in `.pem` format must be specified."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure client-side TLS/SSL session requirements are specified when using RDS Proxy.",
    "Reference": "Section: Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "For MySQL, use the `--ssl-mode` parameter; for PostgreSQL, use `sslmode=require`."
  },
  {
    "Description": "During failover, RDS Proxy should keep accepting connections at the same IP and direct to the new primary DB instance automatically.",
    "Reference": "Section: Failover - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "Ensures minimal disruption during failovers by maintaining connection handling."
  },
  {
    "Description": "RDS Proxy should utilize existing native TLS/SSL configurations and enforce encryption for connections.",
    "Reference": "Section: RDS Proxy security - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html",
    "Observations": "RDS Proxy supports different versions of TLS, allowing greater security flexibility."
  }
]
```

These entries are designed for automated implementation of security configurations within an AWS environment using Amazon RDS Proxy. They focus on secure connections, authentication, and operational resilience such as failover handling.
