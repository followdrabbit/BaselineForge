Below are the extracted technical and operational requirements from the provided documentation, structured in JSON format for easier integration into automated processes:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "RDS Proxy must use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the metric 'DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned' to track how frequently session pinning occurs.",
    "Reference": "Monitoring RDS Proxy metrics with Amazon CloudWatch - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure that AWS CloudWatch is configured to alert based on thresholds for the 'DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned' metric."
  },
  {
    "Description": "For MySQL engine database, apply a session pinning filter to the proxy to exempt certain operations from causing session pinning.",
    "Reference": "Minimizing pinning - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html",
    "Observations": "Evaluate the operations that can safely avoid session pinning without affecting application behavior."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Implement policies to avoid unnecessary database requests that might cause session pinning in RDS Proxy.",
    "Reference": "Avoiding pinning an RDS Proxy - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html",
    "Observations": "Modify application code or workloads to minimize conditions leading to session pinning."
  },
  {
    "Description": "For MySQL and MariaDB databases, session pinning must not occur when using the 'SET LOCAL' statement.",
    "Reference": "Conditions that cause pinning for RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure application uses 'SET LOCAL' for session-specific configurations to avoid pinning."
  },
  {
    "Description": "RDS Proxy must not pin connections upon execution of 'SET' statements at session scope with variables 'TRANSACTION_ISOLATION' and 'TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY'.",
    "Reference": "What RDS Proxy tracks for RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL databases - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html",
    "Observations": "Review applications for appropriate use of 'SET' operations at session level to optimize connection reuse."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Implement session pinning filters to allow customization of statements or functions that can skip pinning behavior.",
    "Reference": "Conditions that cause pinning for all engine families - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html",
    "Observations": "Custom filters can be particularly useful for complex applications requiring specific session state management."
  }
]
```

These requirements focus on minimizing session pinning to improve performance and optimize database connections, leveraging AWS CloudWatch for monitoring, and using session pinning filters to exclude certain operations from causing pinning where possible.
