    "Title": "Enforce Resource-Specific IAM Policies for AWS Cloud WAN",
    "Description": "IAM policies must be configured to grant permissions only for the specific AWS Cloud WAN resources and API actions needed by each user. This restricts users to minimal required access, aligning with the principle of least privilege.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM users interacting with AWS Cloud WAN services",
    "Security Risk": "Without precise IAM policies, users may gain unnecessary permissions, leading to potential misuse or unauthorized actions on AWS resources, compromising confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not restrict access by default, requiring user-defined IAM policies.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced and monitored using AWS IAM policy evaluations and audits with AWS IAM Access Analyzer.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-security.html#identity-access-management"
    ]
  },
  {
    "Title": "Use Condition Keys for Fine-Grained AWS Cloud WAN Access Control",
    "Description": "In IAM policies for AWS Cloud WAN, utilize condition keys such as 'networkmanager:vpcArn', 'networkmanager:subnetArns', and 'networkmanager:vpnConnectionArn' to grant access based on specific VPCs, subnets, and VPN connections.",
    "Applicability": "IAM policies associated with AWS Cloud WAN services",
    "Security Risk": "Without using condition keys, users may gain broader access than necessary, increasing risks of unauthorized modification or access to resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Condition keys need to be manually added to IAM policies to take effect.",
    "Automation": "Can be validated using AWS IAM policy simulator and AWS IAM Access Analyzer for potential alerts.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-security.html#condition-keys"

    "Title": "Implement Tag-Based Access Control for AWS Cloud WAN Resources",
    "Description": "Attach tags to AWS Cloud WAN resources and use them in IAM policy conditions ('aws:ResourceTag/key-name', 'aws:RequestTag/key-name', or 'aws:TagKeys') to enforce access based on tagging.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Cloud WAN resources that require access management",
    "Security Risk": "Without tag-based access control, it is harder to enforce fine-grained permissions, leading to potential unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Tags need to be manually applied to resources and referenced in policies.",
    "Automation": "Tag compliance can be monitored using AWS Config rules like `required-tags` and evaluated in IAM policy conditions.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-security.html#tag-resources",

  {
    "Title": "Define and Apply a Tagging Strategy for AWS Cloud WAN Resource Management",
    "Description": "Establish a consistent tagging strategy for AWS Cloud WAN resources such as Core network, Core network attachments, and Connect peer to support organization, management, and access control.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Cloud WAN resources needing organizational clarity",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of a tagging strategy can lead to unmanaged resources and ineffective access controls, potentially resulting in unauthorized access and operational inefficiencies.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "No tagging strategy is enforced by default; it requires implementation by users.",
    "Automation": "Tagging strategy adherence can be monitored using AWS Config's custom rules or Lambda functions to ensure consistency.",
    "References": [
