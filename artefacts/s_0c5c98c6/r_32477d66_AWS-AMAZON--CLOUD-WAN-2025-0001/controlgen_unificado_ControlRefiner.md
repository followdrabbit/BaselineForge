    "Title": "Enforce Fine-Grained IAM Control for AWS Cloud WAN",
    "Description": "Configure IAM policies to grant permissions only for specific AWS Cloud WAN resources and API actions needed by each user. Utilize condition keys like 'networkmanager:vpcArn', 'networkmanager:subnetArns', and 'networkmanager:vpnConnectionArn', combined with resource tags (aws:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, aws:TagKeys) to ensure fine-grained access control, adhering to the principle of least privilege.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM users and policies associated with AWS Cloud WAN services",
    "Security Risk": "Insufficiently specific IAM policies can result in users gaining unnecessary permissions, which could lead to misuse or unauthorized actions, compromising confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not enforce fine-grained policies by default. Custom IAM policies must be manually defined.",
    "Automation": "Compliance can be enforced and audited using AWS IAM Access Analyzer, AWS Config for tag compliance, and AWS IAM policy simulator for accuracy.",

    "Title": "Implement and Monitor a Tagging Strategy for AWS Cloud WAN",
    "Description": "Create and enforce a consistent tagging strategy for AWS Cloud WAN resources, such as Core network, Core network attachments, and Connect peer, to facilitate organizational clarity, management, and access control. Tags should be used in IAM policy conditions to manage access.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Cloud WAN resources requiring organizational clarity and controlled access management",
    "Security Risk": "Without a coherent tagging strategy, resources may become unmanaged, leading to ineffective access controls and unauthorized access while causing operational inefficiencies.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "No default tagging strategy is enforced; user implementation is required.",
    "Automation": "Monitor tagging strategy adherence with AWS Config custom rules or Lambda functions for consistency, and evaluate tag-based access through IAM policies.",
