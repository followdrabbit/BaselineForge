    "Title": "Enforce Fine-Grained IAM Control for AWS Cloud WAN",
    "Risk Description": "Without fine-grained IAM control, users could obtain excessive permissions on AWS Cloud WAN resources, leading to potential misuse or unauthorized actions. Such unregulated access increases the risk of insider threats, data breaches, and the compromise of network configuration integrity, which can critically impact financial operations and regulatory compliance.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Excessive permissions can expose sensitive financial data and internal network configurations.",
      "Integrity": "High - Unauthorized users may alter configurations and data, leading to compromised integrity of critical financial systems.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Improper access control can lead to changes disrupting service availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to implement fine-grained IAM controls can lead to non-compliance with ISO 27001, which mandates the principle of least privilege and regular access reviews. BACEN regulations also enforce strict access controls to maintain confidentiality and integrity of financial data.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Medium - While suspicious activity may be detected if proper logging is in place, internal threats using legitimate user credentials can be challenging to identify and may cause unnoticed damage before mitigation.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Implement and Monitor a Tagging Strategy for AWS Cloud WAN",
    "Risk Description": "Without an enforced tagging strategy, AWS Cloud WAN resources may lack organizational visibility and proper access management. This can lead to inefficient IAM policy application, unauthorized access, and management complexities, increasing the risk of data exposure and operational disruptions.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Lack of clear tagging can lead to misconfigured access controls, exposing sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Mismanaged resources due to poor tagging can result in erroneous configurations, affecting data integrity.",
      "Availability": "Low - Tagging issues are less likely to directly impact system availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "A lack of tagging strategy could hinder access management and auditability, compromising ISO 27001 compliance which requires resource management and access control efficiency. It may also lead to indirect data protection failures under LGPD due to mishandled resources.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Low - Tagging inconsistencies are relatively easy to spot and rectify with proper monitoring and automated auditing tools.",
    "Risk Level": "Medium"
