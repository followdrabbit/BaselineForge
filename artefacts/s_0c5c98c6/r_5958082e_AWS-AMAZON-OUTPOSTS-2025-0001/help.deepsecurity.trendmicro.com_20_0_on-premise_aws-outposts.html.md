# Protect an account running in AWS Outposts

Deep Security supports AWS accounts running on [AWS
Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/).

To protect your AWS accounts in Outposts:

  1. [Add an AWS account using a manager instance role](aws-add-manager-role.html) . .

Once you've added your AWS account to Deep Security Manager, the **Computers**
page will display the resource as part of the AWS region the Outpost is
connected to. For EC2 instances, the ARN of the Outpost rack is added to the
instance metadata.

  1. [Install the agent on Amazon EC2 and WorkSpaces](aws-agent-install.html).
  2. [Activate the agent](agent-activate.html).
  3. [Create policies](policy-create.html).

High availability is supported. For more information, see [Install Deep
Security Manager on multiple nodes](manager-multi-node.html).
