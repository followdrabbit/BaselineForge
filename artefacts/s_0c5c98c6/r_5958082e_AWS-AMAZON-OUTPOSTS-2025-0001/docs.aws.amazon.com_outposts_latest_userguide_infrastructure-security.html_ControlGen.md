    "Title": "Enforce TLS 1.2 or Higher for API Calls to AWS Outposts",
    "Description": "Ensure that all API calls to AWS Outposts are using TLS 1.2 or higher to secure data in transit. TLS 1.3 is recommended for enhanced security.",
    "Applicability": "All API calls to AWS Outposts",
    "Security Risk": "Using lower versions of TLS may expose data to interception due to weaker encryption standards, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "TLS 1.2 or higher is not enforced by default for all configurations, and manual configuration is necessary to ensure compliance.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored using AWS Config rules for TLS policies and AWS Certificate Manager to enforce correct TLS versions.",

    "Applicability": "All systems interacting with AWS Outposts",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of PFS may lead to the compromise of all past communications if current encryption keys are compromised.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "PFS is not enforced by default and requires selection of appropriate cipher suites in configurations.",
    "Automation": "Configuration checks can be automated using AWS Config, ensuring that only compliant cipher suites are used.",

    "Description": "Ensure all requests to AWS Outposts are signed using an IAM principal with an access key ID and secret access key, or AWS STS for temporary security credentials.",
    "Applicability": "All user and service interactions with AWS Outposts",
    "Security Risk": "Unsigned or incorrectly signed API requests may lead to unauthorized access, compromising system integrity and confidentiality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS requires signed requests for API calls, but proper implementation must be ensured in application code.",
    "Automation": "Monitor compliance using AWS IAM access analysis and automated key rotation practices.",

    "Security Risk": "Without VPC Flow Logs, tracking and analyzing network traffic may be impaired, making it difficult to detect security incidents.",

    "Security Risk": "Without tamper monitoring, unauthorized physical alterations could compromise the integrity and security of data.",
