    "Title": "Install Sysdig Agent for EC2, EKS, and ECS Monitoring",
    "Description": "Deploy the Sysdig agent across all EC2, EKS, and ECS instances in AWS Cloud and Outposts. Use available automation frameworks such as AWS Systems Manager or native Sysdig workflows to ensure consistent installation and configuration for monitoring system and security events.",
    "Applicability": "All EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and ECS tasks in AWS Cloud and Outposts",
    "Security Risk": "Without consistent monitoring, anomalies in system performance and potential security threats may go undetected, leading to operational inefficiencies and compromises.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "There are no default AWS mechanisms for installing third-party agents like Sysdig. Installation must be managed via automation scripts or tools.",
    "Automation": "Deployment can be automated using AWS Systems Manager or Sysdig's own deployment scripts.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS environments utilizing Sysdig for monitoring",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of comprehensive metadata can hinder incident response and operational insight into the environment.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Metadata collection is not natively handled by AWS for third-party tools.",

    "Description": "Configure Sysdig to continuously gather metrics and telemetry for infrastructure and applications on AWS Outposts. Utilize these metrics for real-time monitoring, alerting, and performance visualization dashboards.",
    "Applicability": "AWS Outposts environments",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to collect and respond to metrics in real time may result in delayed detection of performance bottlenecks or security threats.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not automatically integrate into Sysdig without configuration.",
    "Automation": "Integration and metric collection can be managed via Sysdig configurations.",

    "Applicability": "All containerized workloads in AWS using Sysdig",
    "Security Risk": "Without active detection of runtime anomalies, threats can lead to severe breaches or data loss.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Runtime security is not natively provided by AWS for third-party tools.",

    "Applicability": "All EKS clusters",
    "Security Risk": "Without audit logs, unauthorized actions or changes may go unnoticed, complicating any investigation efforts.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS EKS provides audit logs, but they must be configured to export to Sysdig for analysis.",
    "Automation": "Audit logs can be collected with Sysdig configurations or AWS CloudWatch log integration.",

    "Title": "Automate Security Responses for Policy Compliance using Sysdig",
    "Description": "Configure Sysdig to automate security incident responses, such as shutting down containers that violate policies, to enforce security posture automatically.",
    "Applicability": "All environments using Sysdig with container workloads",
    "Security Risk": "Manual intervention delays can expose the system to prolonged threats.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not provide automated responses for third-party monitoring tools by default.",
    "Automation": "Sysdig allows policy-driven automated responses.",

    "Applicability": "All environments utilizing Docker and Kubernetes",
    "Security Risk": "Non-compliance with security benchmarks may increase vulnerability exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Benchmarking must be configured and run manually, as AWS does not provide these tools natively.",
    "Automation": "These checks can be incorporated into CI/CD pipelines using automation scripts.",
