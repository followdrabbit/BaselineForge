    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Outposts",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect role configuration could prevent private connectivity, leading to isolation from other AWS resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS typically configures this role automatically during initial Outposts setup via the Management Console.",
