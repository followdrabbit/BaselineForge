    "Title": "Enable and Enforce MFA for AWS Outposts Users",
    "Description": "Identity-based policies for AWS Outposts users must include conditions to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible to enhance security. Ensure IAM users and roles associated with AWS Outposts are configured with MFA requirements via IAM policies.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Outposts users and roles",
    "Security Risk": "Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to AWS Outposts, thereby putting the confidentiality and integrity of resources at risk.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not enforce MFA for users by default. It requires configuration.",
