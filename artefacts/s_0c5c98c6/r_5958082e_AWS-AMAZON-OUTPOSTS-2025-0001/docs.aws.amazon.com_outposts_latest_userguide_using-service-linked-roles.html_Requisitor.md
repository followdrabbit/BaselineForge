Based on the provided AWS Outposts documentation, here are the technical and operational requirements that can potentially be converted into automated security controls:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Ensure the AWS Outposts service-linked role (AWSServiceRoleForOutposts_`OutpostID`) is present and configured correctly to allow Outposts to access AWS resources for private connectivity.",
    "Reference": "Section: Service-linked role permissions for AWS Outposts (Markdown) - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Verify if AWS automatically configures this during setup via the AWS Management Console."
  },
  {
    "Description": "The AWSServiceRoleForOutposts_`OutpostID` service-linked role must trust 'outposts.amazonaws.com' to assume the role.",
    "Reference": "Section: Service-linked role permissions for AWS Outposts (Markdown) - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "This trust relationship is required for the service-linked role to function as intended."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Service-linked role AWSOutpostsServiceRolePolicy must allow actions `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`, `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`, `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`, and `ec2:CreateNetworkInterface` on all AWS resources.",
    "Reference": "Section: Service-linked role permissions for AWS Outposts (Markdown) - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "These permissions are necessary for private connectivity and network management."
  },
  {
    "Description": "AWSOutpostsPrivateConnectivityPolicy_`OutpostID` must enforce conditions on actions `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`, `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`, `ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission`, and `ec2:CreateTags` using specific resource tags.",
    "Reference": "Section: Service-linked role permissions for AWS Outposts (Markdown) - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Check that resource tags follow the format and conditions specified in the documentation."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Confirm the deletion of the AWSServiceRoleForOutposts_`OutpostID` role if the associated AWS Outposts resource is no longer needed.",
    "Reference": "Section: Delete a service-linked role for AWS Outposts (Markdown) - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure that the Outpost and shared resources are cleaned up before attempting role deletion."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure AWS Outposts is not shared using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) before attempting to delete related service-linked roles.",
    "Reference": "Section: Delete a service-linked role for AWS Outposts (Markdown) - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html",
    "Observations": "Verify sharing settings to avoid errors during deletion attempts."
  }
]
```

These extracted requirements can now be used as the basis for setting up automated security checks or configurations in AWS environments utilizing Outposts.
