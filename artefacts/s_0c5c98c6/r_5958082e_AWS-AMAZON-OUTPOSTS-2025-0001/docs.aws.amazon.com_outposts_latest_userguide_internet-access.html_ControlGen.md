    "Title": "Route Internet Traffic Via NAT Gateway for AWS Outposts",
    "Description": "Configure the route table associated with the Outposts subnet to forward all outbound internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through a NAT gateway in the parent AWS Region VPC to ensure secure internet access.",
    "Applicability": "Outposts with subnets requiring internet access via the parent AWS Region",
    "Security Risk": "Improper routing configurations can expose internal resources to internet-based threats without additional layers of security.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not automatically configure NAT gateways for Outposts; manual setup is required.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored using AWS Config to ensure that the route tables have the correct configurations. Use AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and Amazon CloudFront for added security.",

    "Title": "Validate Non-Conflicting CIDR Blocks for Outposts Direct VPC Routing",
    "Description": "Ensure that the CIDR block assigned to the AWS Outposts subnet does not overlap with on-premises network CIDR blocks when using Direct VPC Routing.",
    "Applicability": "Outposts with Direct VPC Routing configurations",
    "Security Risk": "Overlapping CIDR blocks can cause network packets to be misrouted, leading to network communication issues and potential data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CIDR conflicts must be resolved during planning stages and cannot be automatically checked by AWS.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required as CIDR planning must be validated externally before configuration.",

    "Title": "Restrict Default Route Propagation via Local Gateway",
    "Description": "Ensure the default route (0/0) is not propagated through the Local Gateway (LGW) in AWS Outposts to prevent instances from losing access to AWS service endpoints.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Outposts using Local Gateway for network connectivity",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect route propagation can isolate VPC resources from necessary AWS services, impacting availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Default routes are not propagated automatically; requires manual configuration.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS Config rules to monitor route configurations in VPC route tables and ensure compliance.",

    "Title": "Monitor Service Link Bandwidth Utilization",
    "Description": "Implement CloudWatch monitoring and alerts on the service link bandwidth utilization for Outposts using internet access through the parent AWS Region to proactively manage capacity and ensure network stability.",
    "Applicability": "AWS Outposts using the parent AWS Region for internet access",
    "Security Risk": "High bandwidth utilization may disrupt control plane operations and increase latency or downtime.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Monitoring bandwidth requires manual setup of CloudWatch metrics and alarms.",
    "Automation": "Automate monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics. Set alarms to notify administrators when utilization exceeds thresholds.",
