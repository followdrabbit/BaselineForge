    "Title": "Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with Interface VPC Endpoints",
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling instances use an interface VPC endpoint to restrict network traffic to the AWS network. This avoids using an internet gateway, NAT device, or virtual private gateway.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS environments using EC2 Auto Scaling",
    "Security Risk": "Without an interface VPC endpoint, EC2 Auto Scaling traffic may traverse the public internet, increasing the risk of eavesdropping and unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Using an interface VPC endpoint is not configured by default; it requires manual setup.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `vpc-endpoint-required`.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-vpc-endpoints.html"

    "Title": "Create Interface VPC Endpoint for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling",
    "Description": "Create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling using the service name com.amazonaws.region.autoscaling to ensure private connectivity via AWS PrivateLink.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS environments using EC2 Auto Scaling",
    "Security Risk": "Without a dedicated VPC endpoint, communication with EC2 Auto Scaling may be exposed to insecure channels.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Manual creation of the VPC endpoint is required, it is not automatically provisioned.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored using AWS Config custom rule or AWS CloudFormation template for endpoint configuration.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html"

  {
    "Title": "Attach VPC Endpoint Policy to Control EC2 Auto Scaling API Access",
    "Description": "Attach a policy to the VPC endpoint to control access to the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API. The policy should specify the principal, allowed actions, and resources, including denying the deletion of scaling policies while allowing other actions.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS environments using EC2 Auto Scaling with VPC endpoint",
    "Security Risk": "Without restricting API access, unauthorized users may perform destructive actions on Auto Scaling resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "There is no default policy; endpoint policies must be created and configured.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS IAM policies in combination with AWS Config or AWS CloudFormation.",
