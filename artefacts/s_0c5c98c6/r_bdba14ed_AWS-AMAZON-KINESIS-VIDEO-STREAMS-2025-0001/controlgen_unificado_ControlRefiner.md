    "Title": "Enforce Least Privilege Access in IAM for Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Description": "IAM policies must be crafted to provide only necessary permissions for Kinesis Video Streams. Ensure producer roles are limited to 'PutMedia', 'GetStreamingEndpoint', and 'DescribeStream'. Avoid wildcard permissions.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Security Risk": "Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of video streams, impacting data confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS IAM allows wildcard permissions by default. Policies need to be explicitly defined to enforce least privilege.",
