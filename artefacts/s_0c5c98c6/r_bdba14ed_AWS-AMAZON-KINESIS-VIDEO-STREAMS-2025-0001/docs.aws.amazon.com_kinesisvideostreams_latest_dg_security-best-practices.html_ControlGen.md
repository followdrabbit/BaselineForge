    "Title": "Enforce Least Privilege Access for Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Description": "IAM policies must be configured to grant only the necessary permissions for accessing Kinesis Video Streams resources. Ensure producer applications are restricted to `PutMedia`, `GetStreamingEndpoint`, and `DescribeStream`, and do not use wildcard permissions.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Security Risk": "Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of video streams, impacting data confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS IAM allows wildcard permissions by default. Policies need to be explicitly defined to enforce least privilege.",
    "Automation": "Can be audited using AWS Config rule `iam-policy-no-statements-with-admin-access` to identify policies with broad permissions.",

    "Description": "Configure IAM roles to provide temporary credentials for producer and client applications accessing Kinesis Video Streams, avoiding the use of long-term credentials within applications.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Security Risk": "Storing permanent AWS credentials in applications increases the risk of credential exposure and potential unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS recommends using IAM roles for temporary access but it is not enforced by default. Implementation must be configured.",
    "Automation": "Monitor compliance using AWS Config rule `iam-user-use` to ensure IAM users are not storing long-term credentials.",

    "Title": "Enable CloudTrail Logging for Kinesis Video Streams API Calls",
    "Description": "AWS CloudTrail must be enabled and configured to log all API calls to Kinesis Video Streams for audit and monitoring purposes.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Security Risk": "Without logging, actions taken on Kinesis Video Streams cannot be audited or investigated, which can hinder the detection and response to unauthorized activities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CloudTrail is not enabled by default; manual configuration is required.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `cloud-trail-enabled` to ensure logging is in place.",
