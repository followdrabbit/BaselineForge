    "Title": "Enforce Least Privilege Access in IAM for Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Risk Description": "Without enforcing least privilege access, excessive permissions could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of video streams, risking data leaks or tampering.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unauthorized access to sensitive video data could result in leaks.",
      "Integrity": "High - Unauthorized permissions may allow data tampering.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Manipulation of permissions might disrupt service operation."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with ISO 27001 and LGPD mandates for minimum necessary access to data.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Regular audits required to identify policy misconfigurations.",
    "Risk Level": "High"

  {
    "Title": "Ensure Encryption of Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Risk Description": "Unencrypted video streams can be intercepted, exposing sensitive data and violating data confidentiality mandates.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Lack of encryption could lead to data breaches.",
      "Integrity": "Low - Encryption primarily protects data privacy.",
      "Availability": "Low - Encryption does not typically affect service availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Violates LGPD and PCI DSS requirements for data protection.",

  {
    "Title": "Monitor AWS KMS API Usage Costs for Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Risk Description": "Unmonitored KMS usage could lead to unexpected costs, impacting financial resources and operational efficiency.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Low - Cost issues do not directly impact data confidentiality.",
      "Integrity": "Low - Financial inefficiencies rather than data integrity issues.",
      "Availability": "Low - Does not affect availability but could impact budget allocations for other services."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "While not a direct regulation violation, unexpected costs may affect budget compliance.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Low",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Easy - AWS provides tools to track and alert on cost usage.",
    "Risk Level": "Low"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Set Up Cross-Account Permissions for Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Risk Description": "Improperly configured cross-account permissions may result in unauthorized data access or disruptions in service sharing.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Misconfigured permissions risk unauthorized data access.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Incorrect permissions could allow data manipulation.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Could disrupt cross-account operations if not properly configured."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Potential breach of LGPD's data security protocols.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Incorrect configurations can be complex to identify and correct.",
    "Risk Level": "High"

  {
    "Title": "Enable Device Streaming to Kinesis Video Streams via AWS IoT",
    "Risk Description": "Without proper encryption and secure credentials, device streams are vulnerable to interception, risking data confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Data interception could reveal sensitive information.",
      "Integrity": "High - Lack of secure encryption could lead to data being changed during transit.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Compromised streams may disrupt the expected data flow."
