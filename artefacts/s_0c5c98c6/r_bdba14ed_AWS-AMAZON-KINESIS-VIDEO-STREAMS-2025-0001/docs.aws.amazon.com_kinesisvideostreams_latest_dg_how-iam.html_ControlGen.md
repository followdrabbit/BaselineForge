    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Security Risk": "Improper ARN formatting may lead to incorrect resource references, resulting in unauthorized access or denial of service.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts managing Kinesis Video Streams",

    "Description": "To enable cross-account access, create an IAM role in the stream-owning account with permissions 'DescribeStream', 'GetDataEndpoint', and 'PutMedia'. Trust the other account via 'sts:AssumeRole'.",
    "Applicability": "AWS accounts requiring cross-account access to Kinesis Video Streams",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of proper role setup can lead to unauthorized access or operational failures.",

    "Security Risk": "Unverified policies can lead to excessive permissions and security vulnerabilities.",
