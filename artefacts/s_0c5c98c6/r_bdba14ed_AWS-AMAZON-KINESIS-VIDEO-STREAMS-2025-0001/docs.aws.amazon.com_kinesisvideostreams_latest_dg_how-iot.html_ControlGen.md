    "Applicability": "All devices sending data to Kinesis Video Streams using AWS IoT",
    "Security Risk": "Without secure encryption and authentication, data streams could be intercepted or spoofed, compromising both confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS IoT requires mutual TLS with X.509 certificates but the configuration must be manually set.",
    "Automation": "AWS IoT and Kinesis Video Streams configuration including IoT policies and IAM roles must be manually verified.",

    "Applicability": "IAM roles associated with AWS IoT devices",
    "Security Risk": "Without precise permissions, either excess privileges may allow data exfiltration, or inadequate permissions may result in service outages.",

    "Security Risk": "Without proper configuration, unauthorized certificates could exploit role assumptions.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IoT policies must be explicitly defined and enforced; AWS does not automatically manage schema constraints for IoT policy details.",
