    "Title": "Configure Interface VPC Endpoint for Amazon SWF",
    "Description": "Create an interface VPC endpoint within Amazon VPC to connect to Amazon SWF, eliminating the need for an internet gateway, NAT instance, or VPN connection. This can be configured via AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, Amazon SWF API, or AWS CloudFormation.",
    "Applicability": "All applicable Amazon VPC environments needing communication with Amazon SWF",
    "Security Risk": "Without using a VPC endpoint, communication with Amazon SWF may require internet access, increasing the attack surface and potential exposure to unauthorized network traffic.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "VPC endpoints for Amazon SWF are not enabled by default and must be configured. Specific configurations depend on region availability and service names.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated and monitored using AWS CloudFormation templates and AWS Config custom rules to ensure endpoint presence and configuration.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-vpc-endpoints.html"

  {
    "Title": "Specify Service Name for VPC Endpoint Connection to Amazon SWF",
    "Description": "During VPC endpoint creation for Amazon SWF, ensure the correct service name is used as it varies by AWS Region. For example, use 'com.amazonaws.us-iso-east-1.swf' in the AWS Top Secret - East Region.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts utilizing VPC endpoints for Amazon SWF connections across different regions",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect service names can lead to failed connections or unintended configurations that might result in service disruptions.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Service names must be specified as they vary by AWS region; there are no defaults for unspecified regions.",
    "Automation": "This step requires manual confirmation of service names during initial setup but can be maintained programmatically through script or templates for compliance.",

    "Title": "Attach IAM Endpoint Policy for Amazon SWF VPC Endpoint",
    "Description": "Attach a specific AWS IAM endpoint policy during the creation of a VPC endpoint for Amazon SWF to control access. Utilize complex IAM rules by combining multiple endpoint policies to enforce fine-grained access controls.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS VPCs with endpoint connections to Amazon SWF requiring controlled access",
    "Security Risk": "Without endpoint policies, connections could allow unrestricted access, leading to potential data leakage or modification by unauthorized users.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM policies need to be specified as there is no default endpoint policy associated with VPC endpoints.",
    "Automation": "Attach and audit endpoint policies using AWS IAM and AWS Config to verify the policies are in place and enforced correctly.",
