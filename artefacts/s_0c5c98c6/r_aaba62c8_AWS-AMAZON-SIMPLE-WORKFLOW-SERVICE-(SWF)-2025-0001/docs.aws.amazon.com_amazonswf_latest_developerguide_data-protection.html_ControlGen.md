    "Title": "Implement Least Privilege Access Control",
    "Description": "Utilize AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS IAM to create individual user accounts, ensuring each user is provisioned with only the permissions necessary for their job functions. Implement IAM policies to adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potentially leading to data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS IAM provides tools for implementing least privilege but requires manual configuration of policies.",
    "Automation": "Enforce using AWS IAM policies and monitor with AWS Config rules such as `iam-user-no-policies` to ensure no users have broad permissions.",

    "Title": "Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All Users",
    "Description": "Enable MFA for all users, including the root AWS account. Ensure that MFA is configured using either virtual MFA devices or physical MFA tokens.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts and users",
    "Security Risk": "Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not enforce MFA by default; it must be configured for each user.",
    "Automation": "Monitor compliance using AWS Config rule `root-account-mfa-enabled` and `iam-user-mfa-enabled`.",

    "Description": "Ensure all communications with AWS resources are conducted over TLS 1.2 or higher. Configure AWS services and resources to reject connections using older TLS versions.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS services using network communication",
    "Security Risk": "Older versions of TLS may have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS services support TLS 1.2 by default, but explicit configurations may be required for some services.",
    "Automation": "Validate and monitor using AWS Config custom rules for specific configuration checks.",

    "Description": "Enable AWS CloudTrail for all AWS accounts in all regions to capture API calls and user activity. Configure CloudTrail to send logs to Amazon S3 for centralized storage.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper logging, unauthorized activities may go unnoticed, leading to undetected security incidents.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail must be manually enabled and configured. Not enabled by default.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Data without encryption is vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Some AWS services enable encryption by default, but it requires configuration to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "Automation": "Enforce using AWS Config rules like `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled`.",

    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts where FIPS compliance is necessary",
    "Security Risk": "Non-compliance with cryptographic standards can lead to regulatory breaches and security vulnerabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Must manually configure applications to use FIPS endpoints.",
    "Automation": "This requires manual validation to ensure the use of correct endpoints.",

    "Security Risk": "Exposed sensitive information can lead to data leaks and security vulnerabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not enforce content checks on tags by default.",
    "Automation": "Manual review recommended; consider custom scripts for automated tag audits.",
