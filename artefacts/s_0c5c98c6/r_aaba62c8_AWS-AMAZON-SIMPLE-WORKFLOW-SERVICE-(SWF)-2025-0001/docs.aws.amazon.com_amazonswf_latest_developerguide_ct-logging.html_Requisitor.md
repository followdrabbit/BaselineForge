Here's an organized extraction of security requirements based on the document content:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Amazon SWF API calls must be captured and logged by AWS CloudTrail for security monitoring.",
    "Reference": "Recording API calls with AWS CloudTrail section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ct-logging.html",
    "Observations": "This enables monitoring of actions performed via the SWF console and code calls to the SWF API."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Configure a multi-Region CloudTrail trail to capture all activities across AWS Regions.",
    "Reference": "CloudTrail trails section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ct-logging.html",
    "Observations": "Multi-Region trails ensure comprehensive activity logging across all AWS Regions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Log data events for Amazon SWF resource types using CloudTrail console, AWS CLI, or CloudTrail API operations.",
    "Reference": "Data events in CloudTrail section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ct-logging.html",
    "Observations": "Data events are not logged by default and need explicit configuration."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Implement advanced event selectors in CloudTrail to log specific Amazon SWF data events of interest by filtering on fields like eventName, readOnly, and resources.ARN.",
    "Reference": "Data events in CloudTrail section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ct-logging.html",
    "Observations": "Advanced selectors allow focused logging to reduce noise and storage costs."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure management events are captured by default in CloudTrail for Amazon SWF service regarding control plane operations.",
    "Reference": "Management events in CloudTrail section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ct-logging.html",
    "Observations": "Contains important AWS account management actions."
  }
]
```

These extracted requirements outline security controls that can be automated through AWS services, specifically focusing on logging and monitoring configurations using AWS CloudTrail.
