    "Title": "Configure CloudWatch Alarms for AWS Global Accelerator Metrics",
    "Description": "Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor AWS Global Accelerator metrics such as 'NewFlowCount', 'ProcessedBytesOut', and 'ConsumedLCUs'. Alarms should trigger notifications or automated actions if the defined thresholds are exceeded. Ensure real-time monitoring by enabling metrics immediately after deploying an accelerator.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Global Accelerator",
    "Security Risk": "Without real-time monitoring of Global Accelerator metrics, potential issues like exceeded capacity or DDoS attempts might go unnoticed, leading to service disruptions.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Amazon CloudWatch does not automatically configure alarms; they must be set up manually.",
    "Automation": "Can be configured using AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy and manage CloudWatch alarms for specified metrics.",

    "Title": "Enable Global Accelerator Flow Logs",
    "Description": "Set up flow logs for AWS Global Accelerator to record detailed traffic data, including source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and the number of packets and bytes transferred. This data is integral for security reviews and audit processes.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Global Accelerator",
    "Security Risk": "Without flow logs, it is challenging to conduct thorough security audits and monitor traffic patterns, which might lead to undetected malicious activities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Flow logs are not enabled by default and need to be configured manually.",
    "Automation": "Can be integrated with AWS CloudFormation or CLI scripts to automate the setup of Global Accelerator flow logs.",

    "Title": "Enable AWS CloudTrail for Global Accelerator API Activity",
    "Description": "Activate AWS CloudTrail to log all API calls related to AWS Global Accelerator, capturing detailed information about every request made to the service, including modifications and access queries performed via the console, SDKs, or command-line tools.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Global Accelerator",
    "Security Risk": "Without CloudTrail logging, crucial details of API-level activities are not preserved, impairing incident investigations and audit processes.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail logging must be manually enabled for each account and region used.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rules to ensure CloudTrail is active and capturing necessary logs.",
