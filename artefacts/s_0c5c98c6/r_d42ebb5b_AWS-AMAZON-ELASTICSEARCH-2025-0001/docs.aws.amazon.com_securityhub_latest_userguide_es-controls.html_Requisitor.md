Here's the structured output in JSON format, extracting automatable security requirements from the given AWS Security Hub controls for Elasticsearch domains:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains must have encryption at rest enabled.",
    "Reference": "ES.1 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - [Encryption of data at rest for Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html)",
    "Observations": "Encryption uses AWS KMS with AES-256 keys. Some instance types do not support this feature."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains must not be publicly accessible.",
    "Reference": "ES.2 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - [Launching your Amazon OpenSearch Service domains within a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/vpc.html)",
    "Observations": "Domains should be within a VPC; public subnets are not recommended."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains must encrypt data sent between nodes.",
    "Reference": "ES.3 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - [Enabling node-to-node encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ntn.html#enabling-ntn)",
    "Observations": "Node-to-node encryption ensures that intra-cluster communications are encrypted. Performance impact should be considered."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domain error logging to CloudWatch Logs should be enabled.",
    "Reference": "ES.4 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - [Enabling log publishing (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createdomain-configure-slow-logs.html#createdomain-configure-slow-logs-console)",
    "Observations": "Logs assist with security audits and diagnosing availability issues. Only 'error' log type checked."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains must have audit logging enabled.",
    "Reference": "ES.5 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - [Enabling audit logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/audit-logs.html#audit-log-enabling)",
    "Observations": "Audit logs track user activity including authentication successes and failures."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains must have at least three data nodes.",
    "Reference": "ES.6 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - Steps to modify data nodes",
    "Observations": "Ensures high availability and fault-tolerance. Recommended for zones to be distributed equally."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains should be configured with at least three dedicated master nodes.",
    "Reference": "ES.7 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - Steps to modify master nodes",
    "Observations": "Improves fault tolerance. More than three may be unnecessary and costlier."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Connections to Elasticsearch domains should be encrypted using the latest TLS security policy.",
    "Reference": "ES.8 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - Use [UpdateDomainConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDomainConfig.html) API",
    "Observations": "Latest TLS policy: Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-PFS-2023-10. Test for performance impacts."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Elasticsearch domains should be tagged.",
    "Reference": "ES.9 - AWS Security Hub User Guide - [Working with tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-awsresourcetagging.html#managedomains-awsresourcetagging-console)",
    "Observations": "Tags help in categorizing and identifying resources. Should avoid PII in tags."
  }
