To extract the technical and operational requirements from the provided AWS Amazon Aurora documentation, I'll focus on automatable security controls. These involve configurations that can be validated or enforced using AWS services like AWS Config, IAM policies, or CloudFormation. Here's a structured JSON output based on your provided documentation:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "VPC must have at least two subnets in two different Availability Zones for DB cluster deployment.",
    "Reference": "Section: Working with a DB cluster in a VPC",
    "Observations": "Ensures high availability in case of a failure in one availability zone."
  },
  {
    "Description": "DB subnet groups must include subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given AWS Region.",
    "Reference": "Section: Working with DB subnet groups",
    "Observations": "Required for fault tolerance and availability."
  },
  {
    "Description": "For public accessibility, VPC attributes 'DNS hostnames' and 'DNS resolution' must be enabled.",
    "Reference": "Section: Working with a DB cluster in a VPC",
    "Observations": "Mandatory for public endpoint resolution."
  },
  {
    "Description": "CIDR blocks in subnets must be large enough to accommodate spare IP addresses for maintenance activities.",
    "Reference": "Section: Working with a DB cluster in a VPC",
    "Observations": "Prevents resource exhaustion during maintenance."
  },
  {
    "Description": "DB subnet groups must support dual-stack mode by having an IPv6 CIDR block associated with them.",
    "Reference": "Section: Dual-stack mode and DB subnet groups",
    "Observations": "Allows the use of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses."
  },
  {
    "Description": "To modify a DB cluster to use dual-stack mode, the DB subnet group must first support dual-stack mode.",
    "Reference": "Section: Modifying IPv4-only DB clusters to use dual-stack mode",
    "Observations": "Ensures network compatibility when switching to dual-stack."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Security groups must allow traffic over both IPv4 and IPv6 for dual-stack mode operation.",
    "Reference": "Section: Working with dual-stack mode DB instances",
    "Observations": "Ensures proper connectivity in dual-stack mode."
  },
  {
    "Description": "DB clusters using dual-stack mode must be private and are not publicly accessible.",
    "Reference": "Section: Limitations for dual-stack network DB clusters",
    "Observations": "Enhances security by restricting public access."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Publicly accessible DB clusters must have subnets with an internet gateway.",
    "Reference": "Section: Hiding a DB cluster in a VPC from the internet",
    "Observations": "Necessary for establishing public connectivity."
  },
  {
    "Description": "When setting instance tenancy attribute to dedicated, ensure the DB instance class is approved for dedicated instances.",
    "Reference": "Section: Working with a DB cluster in a VPC",
    "Observations": "Necessary to ensure compatibility with dedicated hosting."
  }
]
```

### Explanation:

- **Description**: Each item describes a requirement derived from your source, focusing on configurations that can be automated or verified programmatically.
- **Reference**: Points to the specific section in the provided documentation where the requirement is detailed.
- **Observations**: Offers additional context or notes about why the requirement is important or how it relates to AWS service defaults or limitations.

This structured information can serve as a foundation for implementing automated security controls around Amazon Aurora configurations.
