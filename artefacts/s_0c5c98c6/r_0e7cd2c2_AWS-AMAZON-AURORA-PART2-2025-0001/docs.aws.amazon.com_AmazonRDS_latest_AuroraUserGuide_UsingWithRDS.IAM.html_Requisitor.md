To extract technical and operational requirements from the provided documentation that can be converted into automated security controls, we focus on identifying specific configuration and policy requirements within AWS. Here is a structured extraction of such requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used for increased security of AWS accounts.",
    "Reference": "Authenticating with identities - AWS recommends using MFA to increase account security. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html",
    "Observations": "Check if MFA is enabled by default for all IAM users and accounts handling AWS resources."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Rotate access keys regularly for IAM users with long-term credentials.",
    "Reference": "IAM users and groups - It's recommended to rotate access keys regularly for cases that require long-term credentials. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials",
    "Observations": "Verify automation of key rotation schedules for IAM users with active access keys."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure IAM policies are attached to IAM identities or AWS resources to control access permissions.",
    "Reference": "Managing access using policies - An administrator can create policies and attach them to resources and identities. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json",
    "Observations": "Evaluate that no IAM user or role has more permissions than necessary."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use IAM roles for applications running on Amazon EC2 to manage temporary credentials securely.",
    "Reference": "IAM roles - Assign an IAM role to an EC2 instance through an instance profile for temporary credential management. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure no access keys are embedded in EC2 instances configurations."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use AWS Identity Center for centralized access management across AWS accounts and applications.",
    "Reference": "Federated identity - AWS recommends using AWS Identity Center for centralized access control. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html",
    "Observations": "Confirm synchronization configurations between AWS Identity Center and the primary user directory."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Set permissions boundaries to limit the maximum permissions granted to IAM entities.",
    "Reference": "Other policy types - Permissions boundaries limit entity permissions; setting them is recommended for additional control. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure permissions boundaries are in place for roles with sensitive permissions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Restrict AWS root user tasks and avoid its use for everyday operations.",
    "Reference": "AWS account root user - Strongly recommend against using the root user for routine tasks. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#root-user-tasks",
    "Observations": "Investigate any activity logs showing frequent root user access."
  }
]
```

Each requirement includes a precise description, the reference where it is mentioned in the documentation, and additional observations, such as the need to verify default configurations or automate the processes. These requirements allow the foundational setup for building automated security checks within AWS environments.
