    "Title": "Create Interface VPC Endpoint for Amazon RDS API",
    "Description": "Configure an interface VPC endpoint for the Amazon RDS API using the service name `com.amazonaws.region.rds` by leveraging the Amazon VPC console or AWS CLI, and ensure that private DNS is enabled to use the default DNS name for API requests in regions outside AWS China.",
    "Applicability": "All VPCs requiring access to Amazon RDS API without public Internet exposure",
    "Security Risk": "Without a private VPC endpoint, API traffic to Amazon RDS could potentially traverse the public Internet, increasing the risk of data interception and exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Private DNS is not enabled by default in AWS Regions. Must be manually enabled when creating the endpoint.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS CloudFormation scripts or AWS CLI commands to set up the VPC endpoint with appropriate DNS settings.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint"

  {
    "Title": "Enforce VPC Endpoint Policy for Amazon RDS API",
    "Description": "Implement and customize a VPC endpoint policy for the Amazon RDS API that details which AWS IAM principals can perform specified actions on specific resources via the endpoint.",
    "Applicability": "All environments using VPC endpoints to restrict and control Amazon RDS API access",
    "Security Risk": "Using the default full access policy could allow unauthorized access to Amazon RDS resources, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized operations.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "VPC endpoints have full access by default. It is necessary to customize the policy to meet access control requirements.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated with AWS CloudFormation or AWS IAM policy templates for fine-grained access control.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html"

  {
    "Title": "Use AWS PrivateLink for Amazon RDS API Access",
    "Description": "Configure AWS PrivateLink to ensure that access to the Amazon RDS API occurs privately and doesn't require public IP addresses, keeping traffic within the Amazon network.",
    "Applicability": "All VPCs requiring private access to the Amazon RDS API",
    "Security Risk": "Without PrivateLink, data traffic might exit the AWS network, increasing the vulnerability to interception and network-based attacks.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "PrivateLink usage requires setting up interface endpoints and might incur additional costs.",
    "Automation": "Setup can be automated using AWS CloudFormation templates to create and configure necessary VPC endpoints.",

  {
    "Title": "Review Interface Endpoint Properties and Limitations",
    "Description": "Conduct a comprehensive review of interface endpoint properties and limitations before implementing them for RDS API endpoints, including performance constraints and compliance with outlined considerations.",
    "Applicability": "All teams responsible for the configuration and deployment of VPC endpoints",
    "Security Risk": "Ignoring endpoint limitations may lead to sub-optimal configurations that could result in outages or limit service availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Endpoint setup must comply with regional constraints and resource quotas.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required due to variable project-specific constraints and environment factors.",

    "Title": "Verify Amazon RDS API Support for VPC Endpoints by Region",
    "Description": "Ensure that VPC endpoint support for the Amazon RDS API is available in the desired AWS region, taking into consideration any special configurations for non-standard regions such as those in AWS China.",
    "Applicability": "All deployments across various AWS Regions",
    "Security Risk": "Misconfigurations due to unsupported regions could lead to connectivity failures and hinder operations.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Endpoint availability and DNS configurations can vary across regions.",
    "Automation": "Verification requires manual review of AWS regional endpoint documentation.",
