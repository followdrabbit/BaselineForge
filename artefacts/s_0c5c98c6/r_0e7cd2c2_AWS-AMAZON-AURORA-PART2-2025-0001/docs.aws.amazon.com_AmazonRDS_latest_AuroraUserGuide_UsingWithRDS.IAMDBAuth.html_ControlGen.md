    "Title": "Enforce SSL/TLS for IAM Database Authentication",
    "Description": "Configure IAM database authentication to require SSL/TLS for all network traffic to and from the database. This involves enabling SSL/TLS in the database parameter group settings and ensuring that all client connections use SSL/TLS for encryption.",
    "Applicability": "All databases using IAM database authentication",
    "Security Risk": "Without SSL/TLS, data may be transmitted unencrypted across networks, potentially exposing sensitive information to interception.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "SSL/TLS is not enforced by default in RDS configurations and must be explicitly enabled.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored via AWS Config custom rules to ensure SSL/TLS is enforced. Use IAM policies to ensure all users connect via SSL/TLS.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html"

    "Title": "Limit New IAM Database Authentication Connections",
    "Description": "Implement connection pooling or use Amazon RDS Proxy to manage and limit new IAM database authentication connections to no more than 200 per second to prevent throttling.",
    "Applicability": "All RDS instances using IAM database authentication",
    "Security Risk": "Exceeding connection limits may lead to throttling, causing availability issues for clients attempting to authenticate with the database.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "RDS Proxy and connection pooling must be explicitly configured to manage connection rates.",
    "Automation": "Can be configured using RDS Proxy settings and monitored with Amazon CloudWatch metrics.",

    "Title": "Optimize Usage of Authentication Tokens for IAM Database Authentication",
    "Description": "Ensure that authentication tokens for IAM database authentication are reused within their 15-minute validity period to optimize the number of token generation requests and improve system efficiency.",
    "Applicability": "All applications utilizing IAM database authentication",
    "Security Risk": "Frequent token generation can lead to unnecessary API load and potential throttling.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Token reuse optimizations must be implemented in application logic.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required to ensure applications correctly reuse tokens.",

    "Title": "Ensure Sufficient Memory for IAM DB Authentication",
    "Description": "Configure the database cluster to have at least 300 to 1000 MiB of extra memory to ensure reliable connectivity when using IAM database authentication.",
    "Applicability": "All database clusters utilizing IAM DB authentication",
    "Security Risk": "Insufficient memory can lead to instability in handling IAM authentication requests, affecting availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Instance memory must be manually adjusted based on workload requirements.",
    "Automation": "Manual configuration required to adjust memory settings based on instance type and workload needs.",

    "Title": "Implement Additional Logging for IAM Authentication Activities",
    "Description": "Since CloudWatch and CloudTrail do not natively log IAM authentication activities, implement additional logging mechanisms to monitor and audit IAM database authentication events.",
    "Applicability": "All environments requiring detailed logging of IAM authentication activities",
    "Security Risk": "Lack of logging makes it difficult to audit authentication attempts and investigate anomalies.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not provide direct logging of these activities. Custom solutions are required.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required to ensure additional logging mechanisms are implemented.",

    "Title": "Enforce IAM Role-Based Authentication for Aurora PostgreSQL",
    "Description": "Ensure that Aurora PostgreSQL databases utilize the IAM role `rds_iam` for authentication instead of traditional password-based methods for enhanced security.",
    "Applicability": "All Aurora PostgreSQL instances using IAM database authentication",
    "Security Risk": "Using password-based authentication can expose sensitive credentials and increase the risk of unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM role-based authentication must be configured manually for each database instance.",
    "Automation": "Can be audited using custom AWS Config rules or manual validation to ensure `rds_iam` role usage for authentication.",
