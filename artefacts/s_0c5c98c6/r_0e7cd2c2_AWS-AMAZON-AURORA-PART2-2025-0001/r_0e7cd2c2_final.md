Here is the detailed risk assessment for each AWS security control, specifically tailored for the financial banking sector in Brazil, taking into account BACEN, LGPD, and international standards:

```json
[
  {
    "Title": "Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts",
    "Risk Description": "Without MFA, accounts are vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches and financial fraud.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Unauthorized access can result in data manipulation or malicious activities.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Service disruption possible if accounts are compromised."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with ISO 27001 and PCI DSS. Could violate LGPD's data protection requirements.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Credential-based attacks are often hard to detect without vigilant monitoring.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enable AWS CloudTrail for Logging API Calls",
    "Risk Description": "Without logging, detecting unauthorized access and performing incident investigations is highly impaired.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Lack of logging reduces ability to detect and respond to data access violations.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Without logs, data integrity violations may go unnoticed.",
      "Availability": "Low - Availability is generally not impacted by logging."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Essential for compliance with BACEN audit requirements, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Intermediate - While logs can help detect incidents, without them, invisible breaches can occur.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Use IAM Roles for EC2 Instances",
    "Risk Description": "Hard-coded credentials in instances can be easily compromised, leading to unauthorized access.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Hard-coded credentials can provide access to sensitive data if exposed.",
      "Integrity": "High - Compromised credentials can be used to alter data.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Instances may be manipulated or destroyed using stolen credentials."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with security best practices as highlighted in ISO 27001.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Intermediate - Compromise detection may require manual inspection unless robust IAM policies are active.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Restrict Use of AWS Root User",
    "Risk Description": "Root credentials provide full access, and their compromise can lead to total loss of control over resources.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Root access can lead to exposure of all customer data.",
      "Integrity": "High - An attacker can modify or delete critical data.",
      "Availability": "Critical - Services can be disrupted or terminated."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with BACEN's operational resilience requirements and general best security practices.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Root access is often unnoticed until major damage is done.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enable Encryption for Amazon S3 Buckets",
    "Risk Description": "Unencrypted data can be exposed if unauthorized access occurs, endangering sensitive information.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unencrypted data breaches can expose financial and personal data.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Tampering with unencrypted data can occur without detection.",
      "Availability": "Low - Encryption indirectly affects availability, mainly during access."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Essential for LGPD compliance regarding data protection and ISO 27001 standards.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Intermediate - Encryption status is easier to verify compared to monitoring access]",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Ensure VPC Security Group Best Practices",
    "Risk Description": "Improper configuration can allow unauthorized network access, increasing breach risks.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Open ports can expose sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Exploitable services might allow data manipulation.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Unauthorized access can lead to network resource depletion or DoS."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Necessary for maintaining network security as required by ISO 27001 and PCI DSS.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Intermediate - Misconfigurations can be manually audited but pose ongoing risk until resolved.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Implement Multi-AZ Deployments for High Availability",
    "Risk Description": "Single-AZ setups risk downtime during zone failures, impacting critical banking operations.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Low - Doesn’t directly impact confidentiality.",
      "Integrity": "Low - Doesn’t directly impact integrity.",
      "Availability": "High - Ensures services remain operational during regional outages."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Aligns with BACEN's requirements for operational resilience and availability.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Easy - Failures are typically sudden but mitigated by redundancy.",
    "Risk Level": "Medium"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Use AWS PrivateLink for Amazon RDS API Access",
    "Risk Description": "Without PrivateLink, API traffic may traverse the public internet, risking data exposure.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Directly addresses data exposure concerns.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.",
      "Availability": "Low - Generally unaffected."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Supports LGPD mandates for data privacy and secure communications.",

    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Intermediate - Public exposure can be hard to manage without robust monitoring.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  }
