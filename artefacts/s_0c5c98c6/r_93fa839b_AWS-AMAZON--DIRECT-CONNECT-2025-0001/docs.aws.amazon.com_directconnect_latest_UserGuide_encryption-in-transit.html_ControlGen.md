    "Title": "Enforce Data-in-Transit Encryption for AWS Direct Connect",
    "Description": "Configure AWS Direct Connect connections to use IPsec VPN or MACsec to secure data in transit. This ensures data transferred between on-premises data centers and AWS is encrypted, maintaining confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Direct Connect connections",
    "Security Risk": "Without transit encryption, data sent across Direct Connect is susceptible to interception and unauthorized access, compromising confidentiality and data integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS Direct Connect does not encrypt traffic in transit by default. Customers must enable IPsec VPN or MACsec manually.",
    "Automation": "Requires manual configuration of IPsec or MACsec based on network device capabilities. Can be monitored with AWS Config for configuration compliance.",

    "Title": "Enable MACsec on AWS Direct Connect Connections",
    "Description": "For Direct Connect connections that support it, configure MACsec to encrypt data from the corporate data center to the AWS Direct Connect location. MACsec provides secure Layer 2 encryption and ensures data integrity and authenticity.",
    "Applicability": "AWS Direct Connect connections supporting MACsec",
    "Security Risk": "Without MACsec, data traveling over AWS Direct Connect could be vulnerable to unauthorized access at the hardware layer, compromising confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "MACsec configuration depends on the capabilities of the customer's network equipment and the Direct Connect location.",
    "Automation": "MACsec setup is dependent on network hardware and requires manual configuration. Monitoring can be performed using AWS Network Manager and Config to validate that MACsec is enabled.",

    "Title": "Implement AWS Site-to-Site VPN with Direct Connect for Enhanced Security",
    "Description": "Combine AWS Direct Connect with AWS Site-to-Site VPN to create an IPsec-encrypted connection that enhances security. This setup offers a more secure and reliable private connection compared to internet-based VPNs.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Direct Connect setups requiring enhanced security",
    "Security Risk": "Without IPsec encryption, data transferred over AWS Direct Connect could be exposed to potential interception and unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Site-to-Site VPN setup must be configured manually alongside Direct Connect for IPsec encryption.",
    "Automation": "The combination of Site-to-Site VPN with Direct Connect requires manual configuration. AWS Config can be used to ensure VPN is properly established and active.",
