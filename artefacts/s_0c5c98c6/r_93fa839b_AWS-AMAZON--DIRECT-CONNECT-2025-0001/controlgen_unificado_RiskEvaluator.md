    "Title": "Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts",
    "Risk Description": "Without MFA, unauthorized users can access AWS accounts with just a username and password, leading to potential control over AWS resources. This can result in data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and potentially facilitate insider threats, impacting the bank's operations and customer trust.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unauthorized access can expose sensitive banking data stored in AWS.",
      "Integrity": "High - Malicious changes to critical systems and data can occur if unauthorized access is gained.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Unauthorized users could disrupt services by deleting or altering resources."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Lack of MFA may lead to non-compliance with BACEN guidelines and ISO 27001 requirements concerning strict access controls, posing legal and financial risks to the bank.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Unauthorized access through brute-force or phishing attacks is challenging to detect without proper monitoring.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"

    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unencrypted sensitive customer data is vulnerable to exposure and interception.",
      "Integrity": "High - Data may be altered during transmission without encryption, affecting transaction accuracy.",
      "Availability": "Low - Encryption primarily protects confidentiality and integrity rather than availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to encrypt data at rest and in transit may lead to non-compliance with LGPD, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 standards, exposing the bank to penalties and reputational damage.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Data breaches involving unencrypted data may remain unnoticed until significant damage occurs.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enable API and User Activity Logging with AWS CloudTrail",
    "Risk Description": "Without CloudTrail logging, unauthorized activities can go undetected, complicating incident response, investigations, and compliance audits.",

      "Confidentiality": "Low - Direct impact on confidentiality is minimal, but indirect risks exist without audit trails.",
      "Integrity": "High - Lack of logs can prevent identification of data tampering.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Unmonitored destructive actions could disrupt service availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with BACEN requirements for auditability and ISO 27001, impacting forensic readiness and risk management protocols.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Without logging, detecting unauthorized changes or access is challenging.",
    "Risk Level": "High"

  {
    "Title": "Protect Sensitive Data in Amazon S3 with Amazon Macie",
    "Risk Description": "Unprotected sensitive data in S3 can lead to data breaches, non-compliance with data protection laws, and erosion of customer trust.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Sensitive data exposure could result in privacy breaches.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Macie primarily focuses on confidentiality; however, misclassification might affect integrity of data categorization.",
      "Availability": "Low - Doesn't directly impact availability but could lead to restrictions or seizures by authorities."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with LGPD and other data protection regulations could result in substantial fines and operational restrictions.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - While data is constantly generated, monitoring all for compliance without Macie is complex.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Ensure AWS Direct Connect is Secured with Encryption",
    "Risk Description": "Without encryption, data transmitted over Direct Connect is vulnerable to interception, threatening confidentiality and data integrity during transit.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Intercepted unencrypted data breaches customer privacy.",
      "Integrity": "High - Data modification can occur during transit without encryption.",
      "Availability": "Low - Direct Connect's core benefit is reliable connectivity, though interception risks exist."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to encrypt could breach BACEN's stringent data security mandates and ISO standards on secure communications.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Intercepting data packets often go undetected unless closely monitored.",
    "Risk Level": "High"

  {
    "Title": "Configure CloudWatch Alarms for AWS Direct Connect",
    "Risk Description": "Without CloudWatch Alarms, network performance issues and anomalous activities may go unnoticed, leading to service disruption and increased vulnerability to attacks.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Low - Indirect impact through unmonitored access or attack vectors.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Unnoticed attacks could change or manipulate data flow.",
      "Availability": "High - Network issues can cause significant operational downtime."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Impacts on operational continuity directly affect adherence to SLAs and could trigger BACEN scrutiny due to outage impacts.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Real-time monitoring is feasible but needs systematic alarm configurations.",
    "Risk Level": "Medium"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Avoid Storing Sensitive Information in AWS Tags and Text Fields",
    "Risk Description": "Sensitive data exposed through resource tags may be visible in logs and APIs, leading to privacy infringements and unauthorized disclosures.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
