    "Title": "Configure CloudWatch Alarms for AWS Direct Connect",
    "Description": "Set up Amazon CloudWatch Alarms for AWS Direct Connect to monitor essential metrics such as connection uptime and data transfer rates. These alarms should be configured to trigger actions (e.g., sending notifications to an SNS topic or executing an Auto Scaling action) when the metric crosses predefined thresholds. Ensure the alarm state is maintained over a specified number of periods before activating the action.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Direct Connect connections",
    "Security Risk": "Without CloudWatch Alarms, issues like network downtime or unexpected data transfer spikes could go undetected, potentially affecting service availability and leading to undiagnosed performance issues.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudWatch Alarms require manual setup and configuration for each metric and action.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated using AWS CloudFormation or AWS CLI to deploy CloudWatch Alarms. Monitoring can be integrated with AWS Security Hub or SNS for notifications.",

    "Title": "Enable CloudTrail Logging for AWS Direct Connect API Calls",
    "Description": "Configure AWS CloudTrail to log all AWS Direct Connect API calls and send these logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring and storage. Ensure logs are appropriately protected, can be shared between accounts, and are validated to detect unauthorized changes.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts utilizing AWS Direct Connect",
    "Security Risk": "Without CloudTrail logging, unauthorized API calls might go unnoticed, leading to potential security incidents that remain undetected.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail must be enabled manually. Logs require configuration to be forwarded to CloudWatch Logs.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated using AWS CloudFormation for setup and AWS Config rules to ensure CloudTrail is enabled and configured correctly.",
