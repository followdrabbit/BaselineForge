    "Title": "Ensure AWS Direct Connect is Associated with Site-to-Site VPN for Secure Connectivity",
    "Description": "Configure AWS Direct Connect connections to be associated with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN to enable secure connectivity between private networks and AWS resources. This setup provides an additional layer of encryption for data in transit.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using AWS Direct Connect",
    "Security Risk": "Without the use of a VPN, data transmitted over Direct Connect may be exposed to potential interception, jeopardizing the confidentiality and integrity of the data.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "By default, AWS Direct Connect does not automatically establish a Site-to-Site VPN; this must be configured by the user.",
    "Automation": "Automation possible with AWS CloudFormation to set up the AWS Site-to-Site VPN configuration and AWS Config rules to ensure the VPN association is maintained.",

    "Title": "Establish AWS Direct Connect Association with VPC through Virtual Private Gateway or Transit Gateway",
    "Description": "Ensure that AWS Direct Connect connections are properly associated with VPCs using a Virtual Private Gateway or Transit Gateway to secure connectivity. This configuration helps maintain secure and efficient traffic management within AWS resources.",
    "Applicability": "All organizations utilizing AWS Direct Connect for VPC associations",
    "Security Risk": "If Direct Connect is not associated with a VPC properly using appropriate gateways, AWS resources may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, and traffic routing may not be optimized for security.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not automatically establish VPC associations with Direct Connect. Users must manually configure associations through gateways.",
    "Automation": "Automatable using AWS CloudFormation templates for setting up Virtual Private Gateways or Transit Gateways and AWS Config to verify ongoing compliance.",
