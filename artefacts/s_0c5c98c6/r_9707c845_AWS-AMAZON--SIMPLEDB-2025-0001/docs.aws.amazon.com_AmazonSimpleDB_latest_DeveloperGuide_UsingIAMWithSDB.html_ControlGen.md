    "Title": "Enforce IAM Policy Naming Convention for Amazon SimpleDB",
    "Description": "IAM policies granting access to Amazon SimpleDB must specify actions with the prefix 'sdb:'. For instance, use 'sdb:GetAttributes', 'sdb:Select', or 'sdb:*' for all actions to define permissions correctly.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM policies related to Amazon SimpleDB",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to use correct action prefixes might result in improper permissions, which can lead to unauthorized access to SimpleDB resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM does not automatically enforce action prefixes. They must be explicitly defined in IAM policies.",
    "Automation": "Can be audited using AWS Config custom rules or AWS IAM Access Analyzer to ensure adherence to the naming convention.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAMWithSDB.html"

    "Title": "Specify Amazon SimpleDB Domain ARNs with Region",
    "Description": "Amazon SimpleDB domains must be specified using the ARN format `arn:aws:sdb:<region>:<account_ID>:domain/<domain_name>`, ensuring the <region> parameter is not left blank.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM policies and resource-based policies utilizing SimpleDB domains",
    "Security Risk": "Incorrect ARN specification can lead to security breaches or misconfigured access, as resources may not be accurately targeted.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM policy validation will not enforce correct ARN formats unless explicitly checked.",
    "Automation": "Monitoring can be implemented using AWS Config custom rules to validate the correctness of ARNs, focusing on region specification.",

    "Title": "Use Wildcard Characters in SimpleDB Domain ARNs",
    "Description": "Policies may use the `*` wildcard for multiple characters and `?` for single characters in Amazon SimpleDB domain names within ARNs, ensuring flexibility while adhering to naming conventions.",
    "Applicability": "All resource-based IAM policies for Amazon SimpleDB",
    "Security Risk": "Improper use of wildcards may lead to overbroad access or denial of access where intended, compromising security or functionality.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM policy language supports wildcards but requires careful implementation to avoid unintended matches.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required to ensure wildcard usage aligns with resource naming conventions and security requirements.",

  {
    "Title": "Apply Least Privilege Principle for SimpleDB Read Actions",
    "Description": "Policies granting read access to Amazon SimpleDB should specifically allow actions like `sdb:GetAttributes` and `sdb:Select` rather than broad permissions, ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM and resource-based policies granting read access to Amazon SimpleDB",
    "Security Risk": "Granting excessive permissions can lead to unauthorized data access, thus exposing sensitive information.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM policies allow broad permissions but specific permissions must be defined by policy creators.",
    "Automation": "Audited using AWS IAM Access Analyzer for policies respecting least privilege principles.",

  {
    "Title": "Utilize Deny Statements for Restricting Unwanted SimpleDB Actions",
    "Description": "IAM policies should include `Deny` statements to explicitly prevent unwanted actions, specifying precise actions that are allowed, especially when broad permissions are in use.",
    "Applicability": "All IAM policies with conditional broad permissions for Amazon SimpleDB",
    "Security Risk": "Without explicit deny conditions, policies can become too permissive, resulting in unauthorized data manipulation or exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM allows all actions not explicitly denied; care must be taken to define proper deny conditions.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced via AWS IAM Access Analyzer for evaluating policy effectiveness in applying least privilege principles.",
