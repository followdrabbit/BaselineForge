  {
    "Title": "Enforce IAM Policy Naming Convention for Amazon SimpleDB",
    "Risk Description": "If IAM policies do not use the correct 'sdb:' action prefixes, it may lead to misconfigured permissions, allowing unauthorized users to access or alter SimpleDB resources.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Unauthorized actions could expose sensitive data stored in SimpleDB.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Incorrect permissions could allow unauthorized changes to data, affecting data integrity.",
      "Availability": "Low - Direct impact on availability is unlikely unless data alteration indirectly affects operations."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Incorrect access configurations could result in non-compliance with LGPD data protection, ISO 27001's access control requirements, and PCI DSS if applicable data is accessed.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Misconfigurations can be detected with proper auditing tools but may not be immediately apparent.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Specify Correct Amazon SimpleDB Domain ARNs Including Region",
    "Risk Description": "Failure to include correct region specifications in ARNs could lead to misconfigured access, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized data alterations.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Incorrect ARNs can inadvertently allow data access from unintended roles or users.",
      "Integrity": "High - Potential for unauthorized data modifications if incorrect resource permissions are granted.",
      "Availability": "Low - While primarily affecting access, misconfigurations can indirectly affect data availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Incorrect ARN usage can breach BACEN norms for secure configuration management and LGPD data security mandates by incorrectly securing resources.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Misconfigurations might go unnoticed until unauthorized access or operations are executed.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Apply Least Privilege Principle for SimpleDB Read Actions",
    "Risk Description": "Without adhering to least privilege, excessive permissions increase the risk of unauthorized data viewing or sharing, potentially leading to information exposure.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Excessive read permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "Low - Primary concern is data access, not modification.",
      "Availability": "Low - No direct impact on data availability unless incidental."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to enforce least privilege contravenes LGPD data protection requirements and ISO 27001's access controls by allowing excessive access to sensitive data.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Misconfigured policies are detectable with access reviews but could be overlooked without regular checks.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Utilize Deny Statements for Restricting Unwanted SimpleDB Actions",
    "Risk Description": "Without explicit deny statements, policies might be unintentionally permissive, leading to unauthorized data modifications or exposure.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Broad permissions without denies may leak sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Ability to inadvertently perform unauthorized modifications increases without explicit restrictions.",
      "Availability": "Low - Deny statements primarily affect integrity and confidentiality."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Overly permissive policies could violate LGPD and ISO 27001 strictures on data access control by lacking necessary restrictions.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - While detection might be possible through audits, properly crafting denies requires experience.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enforce Use of Temporary Security Credentials for Amazon SimpleDB Access",
    "Risk Description": "Using permanent credentials increases the risk of unauthorized access if they are compromised, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized operations.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Permanent credentials, if exposed, can allow unauthorized data access.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Credentials can be used for unauthorized data changes.",
      "Availability": "Low - Impact on availability is indirect but possible if malicious changes disrupt service."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Permanent credential use compromises compliance with LGPD, BACEN, and ISO 27001 for secure credential management and access control.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Compromised credentials can be used without detection if access patterns mimic legitimate use.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Ensure HMAC-SHA256 Signing Method for SimpleDB Requests Using Temporary Credentials",
    "Risk Description": "Failure to enforce HMAC-SHA256 for signing may result in insecure communications, facilitating unauthorized request modifications or man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Without secure signing, communications can be intercepted and analyzed.",
      "Integrity": "High - Request tampering could occur if insecure signing is used.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Availability could be affected if tampered requests disrupt service."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Insecure request signing methods could breach PCI DSS and ISO 27001 requirements for cryptographic controls.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Man-in-the-middle attacks are often complex to detect without thorough monitoring.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
