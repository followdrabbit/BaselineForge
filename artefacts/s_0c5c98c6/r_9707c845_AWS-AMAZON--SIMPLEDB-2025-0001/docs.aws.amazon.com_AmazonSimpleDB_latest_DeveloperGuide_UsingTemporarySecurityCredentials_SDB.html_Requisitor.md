Here's a structured extraction of automatable requirements derived from the provided Amazon SimpleDB document concerning temporary security credentials:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Users must use temporary security credentials to access Amazon SimpleDB, replacing the standard AWSAccessKeyId with those provided by IAM and including the SecurityToken parameter.",
    "Reference": "Section: Using Temporary Security Credentials - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingTemporarySecurityCredentials_SDB.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure that requests are signed with the SecretKeyId and contain a valid SecurityToken to prevent access denial due to expired credentials."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Requests to Amazon SimpleDB using temporary security credentials must be signed using HMAC-SHA256 method.",
    "Reference": "Example Using Temporary Security Credentials - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingTemporarySecurityCredentials_SDB.html",
    "Observations": "Verify that the SignatureMethod field in requests is set to HmacSHA256."
  }
]
```

### Explanation
- **First requirement:** The document describes how to use IAM-provided credentials for authentication to Amazon SimpleDB, where AWSAccessKeyId is replaced with temporary credentials and requests include a SecurityToken. This process is automatable by setting appropriate IAM roles and policies.
- **Second requirement:** The signing method specified is HMAC-SHA256, which is an actionable configuration component that can be validated through automation in tooling or scripts used for signature generation.
