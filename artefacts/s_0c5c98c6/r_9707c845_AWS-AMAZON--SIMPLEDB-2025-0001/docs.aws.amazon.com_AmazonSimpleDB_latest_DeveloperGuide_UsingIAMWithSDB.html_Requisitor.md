Here is the extracted and structured information for creating automated security controls from the provided Amazon SimpleDB documentation:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "IAM policies must specify Amazon SimpleDB actions with the prefix `sdb:`. For example, `sdb:GetAttributes`, `sdb:Select`, `sdb:*` for all actions.",
    "Reference": "Amazon SimpleDB Actions section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAMWithSDB.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure all IAM policies adhere to this naming convention when granting access to SimpleDB resources."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Amazon SimpleDB domains are specified using the ARN format `arn:aws:sdb:<region>:<account_ID>:domain/<domain_name>`. The <region> must not be blank.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for Amazon SimpleDB section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAMWithSDB.html",
    "Observations": "Use wildcards (*) and (?) for flexible naming in ARNs where appropriate, ensuring regional specification is correct."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Policies must allow using wildcard characters `*` for multiple characters and `?` for a single character in domain names within ARNs.",
    "Reference": "Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for Amazon SimpleDB section - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAMWithSDB.html",
    "Observations": "Ensure wildcard use complies with organizational resource naming conventions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Allow policies for Amazon SimpleDB actions should specify necessary actions such as `GetAttributes` and `Select` when granting read access.",
    "Reference": "Example 2: Allow a group to read data from the AWS Account's domains - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAMWithSDB.html",
    "Observations": "Verify that the least privilege principle is applied, granting only required actions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Policies must use a `Deny` statement to prevent unwanted actions when broad permissions exist, specifying exact actions allowed for resources.",
    "Reference": "Example 4: Allow a partner to only read data from a particular domain - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingIAMWithSDB.html",
    "Observations": "Especially critical when partners need restricted and limited access to specific domains."
