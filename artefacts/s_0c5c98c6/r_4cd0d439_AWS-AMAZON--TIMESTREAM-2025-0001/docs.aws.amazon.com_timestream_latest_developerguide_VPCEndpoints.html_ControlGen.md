    "Title": "Configure Interface VPC Endpoint for Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "An interface VPC endpoint must be configured in the VPC to enable private access to Amazon Timestream for LiveAnalytics APIs, ensuring that the communication occurs without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN, or Direct Connect.",
    "Applicability": "VPC environments accessing Amazon Timestream",
    "Security Risk": "Without an interface VPC endpoint, traffic to Timestream may traverse the public internet, increasing exposure to security threats and potential data leakage.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Interface VPC endpoints are not created by default; they must be manually configured.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored and enforced using AWS Config rule `vpc-endpoint-exists` to ensure VPC endpoints are configured correctly.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/VPCEndpoints.html"

  {
    "Title": "Ensure Private Network Traffic for Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "Utilize AWS PrivateLink by configuring a VPC endpoint to ensure that all traffic between the VPC and Amazon Timestream for LiveAnalytics remains within the AWS network, avoiding the use of public IP addresses or external networks.",
    "Applicability": "All VPCs using Amazon Timestream",
    "Security Risk": "If traffic is not confined to the AWS network, data could be intercepted or exposed to threats on the public internet.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS PrivateLink is not enabled by default; it requires manual setup.",
    "Automation": "Enforcement is possible via AWS Config rules like `vpc-endpoint-exists`, combined with infrastructure as code tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Terraform) to automate and verify configurations.",

      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/VPCEndpoints.html"

  {
    "Title": "Set Up Elastic Network Interfaces for VPC Interface Endpoints",
    "Description": "Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) must be configured in the specified subnets to facilitate each interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Timestream, ensuring proper network communication alignment.",
    "Applicability": "Subnets within VPCs accessing Amazon Timestream",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper ENI configurations, endpoint connectivity may fail, leading to potential service disruptions or security inconsistencies.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "ENIs for VPC endpoints must be explicitly created; they are not automatically configured.",
    "Automation": "Automation can be achieved through AWS CloudFormation templates or Terraform scripts that define ENI configuration as part of the infrastructure setup.",

  {
    "Title": "Create VPC Endpoint Policy for Timestream",
    "Description": "A specific VPC endpoint policy must be created for Timestream to define permissions and regulate access through the endpoint, ensuring only authorized actions are allowed.",
    "Applicability": "VPCs utilizing Timestream with security policies",
    "Security Risk": "Without a defined endpoint policy, unauthorized actions could be performed, potentially leading to data exposure or unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "VPC endpoint policies do not exist by default; they must be explicitly defined and applied.",
    "Automation": "AWS IAM policies can manage and audit endpoint policies, and AWS Config can verify compliance using custom rules.",
