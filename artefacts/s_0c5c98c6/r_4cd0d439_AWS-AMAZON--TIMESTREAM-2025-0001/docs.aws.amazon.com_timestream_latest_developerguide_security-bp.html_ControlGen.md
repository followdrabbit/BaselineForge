    "Title": "Secure and Monitor Encryption Keys for Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "Ensure that all encryption keys used by Amazon Timestream are managed through AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and are secured according to best practices. Regularly audit key usage and configure alarms for revoked or inaccessible keys.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon Timestream deployments using encryption",
    "Security Risk": "If encryption keys become inaccessible, data encryption and decryption processes will be interrupted, leading to potential data loss or service downtime. Unsecured keys can lead to unauthorized data access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS KMS provides key management but does not automatically secure against all revocation scenarios. Customers must configure this.",
    "Automation": "Key management practices can be monitored using AWS Config rules such as `kms-key-rotation-enabled` and by setting CloudWatch alarms for specific key events.",
    "References": [

    "Title": "Audit AWS CloudTrail for Anomalous API Access Patterns in Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "Enable AWS CloudTrail logging for all regions to monitor API access to Amazon Timestream. Configure AWS CloudWatch to trigger alerts on detection of anomalous access patterns or actions from unauthorized users.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts utilizing Amazon Timestream",
    "Security Risk": "Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches and system integrity issues. Without proper monitoring, these actions may go undetected.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CloudTrail must be configured manually to ensure all relevant API calls are logged and monitored.",
    "Automation": "Can be automated using AWS Config to ensure CloudTrail is enabled, coupled with AWS CloudWatch and AWS GuardDuty for continuous monitoring and alerting.",
