    "Title": "Automate Client-Side Dependency Patch Management",
    "Description": "Implement a system to routinely check and patch client-side dependencies for AWS Timestream applications. This can be achieved using AWS Systems Manager's Patch Manager to automate patching tasks for supported environments.",
    "Applicability": "All environments using AWS Timestream client-side applications",
    "Security Risk": "Unpatched software can contain vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized access or attacks, compromising system integrity, and potentially leading to data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not automatically manage client-side patches; integration with AWS Systems Manager is required.",
    "Automation": "AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can be configured to automate the patching of client-side dependencies.",

    "Title": "Integrate Automated Security Checks and Penetration Testing in Deployment Pipelines",
    "Description": "Incorporate automated security testing within CI/CD pipelines for AWS Timestream deployments. Use tools that can perform continuous security assessments, and conduct manual penetration tests periodically as required by AWS guidelines.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS Timestream deployments",
    "Security Risk": "Without security assessments, vulnerabilities may remain unnoticed, jeopardizing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Timestream data.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not perform penetration testing by default; customers are responsible for implementing these tests while adhering to AWS testing policies.",
    "Automation": "Security checks can be automated using AWS CodePipeline with compatible security tools. Manual penetration tests require authorization as per AWS policy.",
