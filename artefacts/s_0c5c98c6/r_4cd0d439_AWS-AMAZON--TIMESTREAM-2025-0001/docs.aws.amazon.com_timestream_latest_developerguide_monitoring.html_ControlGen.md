        "Description": "AWS CloudTrail must be configured to log all API calls to Timestream for LiveAnalytics. Ensure that trails are active in all regions where Timestream is used, capturing both management and data events.",
        "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Timestream for LiveAnalytics",
        "Security Risk": "Without CloudTrail logging, unauthorized access to Timestream resources may go undetected, hindering incident response and forensic analysis.",
        "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS CloudTrail does not log events by default. It must be configured to track specific API calls, including management and data events.",
        "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `cloudtrail-enabled`, ensuring CloudTrail is active and configured to log Timestream API calls. Use AWS Security Hub to verify CloudTrail configuration compliance.",

        "Applicability": "All AWS environments utilizing Timestream",
        "Security Risk": "Failure to monitor system errors could result in undetected operational issues and delayed incident response, affecting the availability and integrity of Timestream operations.",
        "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Amazon CloudWatch does not automatically set up alarms; users must define specific metrics and thresholds.",
