# Configuration and vulnerability analysis in Timestream

Configuration and IT controls are a shared responsibility between AWS and you,
our customer. For more information, see the AWS [shared responsibility
model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/). In
addition to the shared responsibility model, Timestream for LiveAnalytics
users should be aware of the following:

  * It is the customer responsibility to patch their client applications with the relevant client side dependencies.

  * Customers should consider penetration testing if appropriate (see [https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/).)
