    "Title": "Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS Accounts",
    "Description": "Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all AWS IAM users and root accounts to ensure enhanced security. This includes setting up virtual MFA devices, hardware MFA devices, or biometric-based MFA solutions.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without MFA, compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, enabling data breaches or unauthorized modifications.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS IAM does not enforce MFA by default; it must be configured individually for each account user.",
    "Automation": "Enforce using AWS IAM settings and ensure compliance using AWS Config rule `iam-user-mfa-enabled`.",
    "References": [
      "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html"

    "Title": "Require Secure TLS Communication",
    "Description": "Configure all AWS interactions to use TLS version 1.2 or higher to secure data transmissions. For enhanced security, prefer using TLS 1.3.",
    "Applicability": "All services communicating with AWS",
    "Security Risk": "Without enforcing TLS, transmissions could be intercepted or tampered with, leading to data breaches or integrity violations.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "While some AWS services default to secure connections, configurations may vary, necessitating manual validation.",
    "Automation": "Monitor compliance using AWS Config custom rules or AWS Security Hub.",

    "Title": "Enable AWS CloudTrail for API and User Activity Logging",
    "Description": "Set up AWS CloudTrail to log all AWS account activities across all regions to enable auditing and forensic analysis.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without CloudTrail, unauthorized access or malicious activity may go undetected, hindering incident response and auditing capabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail must be enabled and configured manually; it is not enabled by default.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `cloud-trail-enabled`.",

    "Title": "Implement AWS Encryption Solutions",
    "Description": "Utilize AWS-native encryption tools and ensure encryption is enabled for data at rest and in transit. Services like AWS KMS can be used for managing cryptographic keys.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS services storing or transmitting data",
    "Security Risk": "Without encryption, data may be exposed to unauthorized access, leading to confidentiality breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Encryption features need to be activated and configured by the user for various AWS services.",

    "Applicability": "AWS accounts using Amazon S3",
    "Security Risk": "Unprotected sensitive data in S3 can lead to data leakage and privacy violations.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Amazon Macie must be manually enabled and configured.",
    "Automation": "Manage setups through AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, leveraging Macie's automated insights.",

    "Description": "Configure usage of FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules by connecting to AWS services through FIPS-enabled endpoints.",
    "Applicability": "AWS accounts requiring FIPS compliance",
    "Security Risk": "Non-compliance with cryptographic standards may lead to audit failures or decreased data protection guarantees.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Must be explicitly configured; not all services or regions have FIPS endpoints.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required for endpoint configuration.",

    "Title": "Avoid Sensitive Information in Tags or Free-form Fields",
    "Description": "Ensure that confidential or sensitive information is not entered into tags or unstructured fields to prevent it from being exposed in logs or bills.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS services supporting tags",
    "Security Risk": "Sensitive information in tags may leak through logs, leading to privacy violations.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not restrict data types in tags; users must enforce data classification policies.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required; consider using AWS Lambda scripts for tag audits.",
