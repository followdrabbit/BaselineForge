# Logging and monitoring in Timestream for LiveAnalytics

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability,
and performance of Timestream for LiveAnalytics and your AWS solutions. You
should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so
that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. However,
before you start monitoring Timestream for LiveAnalytics, you should create a
monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:

  * What are your monitoring goals?

  * What resources will you monitor?

  * How often will you monitor these resources?

  * What monitoring tools will you use?

  * Who will perform the monitoring tasks?

  * Who should be notified when something goes wrong?

The next step is to establish a baseline for normal Timestream for
LiveAnalytics performance in your environment, by measuring performance at
various times and under different load conditions. As you monitor Timestream
for LiveAnalytics, store historical monitoring data so that you can compare it
with current performance data, identify normal performance patterns and
performance anomalies, and devise methods to address issues.

To establish a baseline, you should, at a minimum, monitor the following
items:

  * System errors, so that you can determine whether any requests resulted in an error.
