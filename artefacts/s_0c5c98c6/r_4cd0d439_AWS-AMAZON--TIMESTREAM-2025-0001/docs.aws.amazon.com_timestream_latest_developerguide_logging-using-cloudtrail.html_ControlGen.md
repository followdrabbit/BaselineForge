    "Title": "Enable CloudTrail for Timestream LiveAnalytics API Operations",
    "Description": "Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to log all supported API operations for Timestream for LiveAnalytics, including 'Query' and management operations. This involves configuring CloudTrail to record these events in all applicable regions.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Timestream for LiveAnalytics",
    "Security Risk": "Without logging, unauthorized access and mistakes remain undetected, undermining data integrity and availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail does not log events by default for specific services or regions; explicit configuration is required.",
    "Automation": "Can be configured using AWS Management Console, SDKs, or CLI. Monitoring can be enforced using AWS Config rule `cloud-trail-enabled`.",
    "References": [

    "Title": "Create a CloudTrail with Continuous Delivery to S3 for Timestream Logs",
    "Description": "Create a CloudTrail trail to continuously deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket from Timestream for LiveAnalytics. Ensure the trail is configured for all AWS Regions to capture a comprehensive set of logs.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts using Timestream for LiveAnalytics",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to retain log data securely can hinder forensic investigations and compliance efforts.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "CloudTrail trails must be explicitly created to store logs in Amazon S3.",
    "Automation": "Trails can be created and configured automatically via AWS CLI or CloudFormation. Use AWS Config rule `s3-bucket-logging-enabled` for ensuring S3 bucket logging.",

    "Title": "Log Timestream 'Query' API Events for Specific Resource Types",
    "Description": "Configure CloudTrail to log 'Query' API events specifically for resources of types 'AWS::Timestream::Database' and 'AWS::Timestream::Table'. Ensure that the trail captures events resulting in validation exceptions due to malformed query strings.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts with resources in Timestream",
    "Security Risk": "Not capturing failed query attempts may allow abuse of service APIs, leading to potential data exfiltration or service disruption.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Specific API event types and resources require explicit trail configuration to be logged.",
    "Automation": "Configuration can be automated using AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates. Monitor with AWS Config rules tailored for API event logging.",

    "Title": "Aggregate CloudTrail Logs from Multiple AWS Accounts and Regions",
    "Description": "Ensure CloudTrail is configured to aggregate logs across multiple AWS accounts and regions. Set up centralized logging for comprehensive monitoring and auditing.",
    "Applicability": "Enterprises with multiple AWS accounts and regions",
    "Security Risk": "Decentralized logs can result in missed security events and non-compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not aggregate logs across accounts and regions by default; centralization must be manually configured.",
    "Automation": "Use AWS Organizations with centralized CloudTrail logging and AWS Config rule `cloud-trail-log-file-validation-enabled` for validation.",

    "Title": "Review CloudTrail Logs for Source Identification",
    "Description": "Periodically review CloudTrail logs to identify request sources and determine if they were made using root credentials, IAM users, or temporary security credentials. This is essential for identifying potential unauthorized access attempts.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Unmonitored access patterns can lead to unnoticed security breaches or misuse of AWS resources.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Review of log data must be performed manually; AWS does not automatically analyze or notify about specific credential use.",
    "Automation": "Manual review required, but can be supplemented with automated notifications and analysis using AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty for suspicious activity alerts.",
