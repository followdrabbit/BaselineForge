    "Title": "Enforce AES-256 Encryption for Data at Rest in Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "Ensure that all data in Amazon Timestream for LiveAnalytics databases is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. This encryption is enabled by default and applies globally, ensuring compliance with data protection requirements.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon Timestream databases",
    "Security Risk": "Without strong encryption standards, sensitive data at rest may be exposed to unauthorized access, compromising confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Amazon Timestream automatically enables AES-256 encryption for all data at rest. This encryption setting cannot be disabled.",
    "Automation": "Encryption is automatically enforced by Amazon Timestream, requiring no additional configuration.",

    "Title": "Utilize AWS KMS for Encryption Operations in Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "Configure AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage keys for encryption at rest operations in Amazon Timestream. Timestream uses `alias/aws/timestream` by default for this purpose.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon Timestream databases",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to utilize a robust key management mechanism like AWS KMS could result in poor encryption practices and unauthorized data access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Timestream automatically employs `alias/aws/timestream` for encryption, leveraging AWS KMS without needing additional setup.",
    "Automation": "Automatically integrated with AWS KMS for encryption operations.",

    "Title": "Allow Use of Customer Managed Keys for Amazon Timestream Encryption",
    "Description": "Enable users to specify a customer managed key in AWS KMS for encrypting Timestream data to provide user-controlled encryption capabilities.",
    "Applicability": "Users with specific encryption customization needs",
    "Security Risk": "Using a customer managed key allows for customized encryption policies and access controls, enhancing security postures.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Users can opt to use their customer managed keys, needing explicit configuration in the console or through AWS CLI.",
    "Automation": "Automation involves setting up and managing customer managed keys in AWS KMS, monitored via IAM and KMS policies.",

    "Title": "Configure KMS Keys for Different Timestream Data Storage Tiers",
    "Description": "Ensure that memory store data is encrypted with Timestream service key while magnetic store data uses a user-specified KMS key for enhanced data security.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon Timestream data at different storage tiers",
    "Security Risk": "Using inappropriate keys could decrease data security, making it vulnerable during transitions and operations.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Memory store data uses Timestream service key by default; magnetic store data requires explicit specification of a KMS key.",
    "Automation": "Configure KMS key settings through AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.",

    "Description": "Require encrypted credentials using user-specified KMS keys for operations against the Timestream Query service.",
    "Applicability": "All users accessing the Timestream Query service",
    "Security Risk": "Without encrypted credentials, there is a higher risk of unauthorized data querying and access breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Users must ensure encryption of credentials using the available KMS keys.",
    "Automation": "Implementation involves configuring and applying KMS keys to user credentials when accessing query services.",

    "Title": "Manage Decryption Key Caching in Amazon Timestream",
    "Description": "Timestream maintains a local cache of decryption keys for 5 minutes, which is automatically updated with permission changes within this timeframe to optimize decryption operations.",
    "Applicability": "All operational environments using Amazon Timestream",
    "Security Risk": "Insufficient caching mechanisms might lead to inefficient decryption operations or delayed permission updates.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "This caching mechanism is automatically managed by Timestream; users cannot modify the caching duration.",
    "Automation": "Caching is managed internally by Amazon Timestream with no required settings.",
