      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Lack of logs won't directly impact confidentiality but hinders forensic analysis.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Difficult to audit alterations or unauthorized access without logs.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Reduced ability to troubleshoot availability issues."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Logging is often required by regulatory frameworks like PCI DSS for audit purposes.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Difficult - Without logs, detection of unauthorized access is harder.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Implement AWS WAF on Internet-Facing ELBs",
    "Risk Description": "ALBs without a WAF are vulnerable to common web attacks like SQL injections, which can lead to data breaches and system compromise.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - WAF mitigates attacks that can expose sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "High - Protects against data tampering attacks.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Reduces risk of service disruptions from attacks like DDoS."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Weak security posture could result in non-compliance with BACEN and PCI DSS, potentially leading to penalties.",

    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Requires active monitoring and WAF rules tuning.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Restrict Security Groups for ELBs",
    "Risk Description": "Open security groups can lead to unauthorized access, potentially facilitating data breaches or unauthorized resource use.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Increased chance of unauthorized alterations.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Unauthorized access could lead to service degradation."

    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with security best practices can lead to violations of BACEN's security guidelines.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Moderate - Security misconfigurations can be monitored, but exploitation risk is significant.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Use Latest Security Policies for SSL/TLS on Load Balancers",
    "Risk Description": "Outdated security policies can be exploited, leading to intercepted and compromised communications.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Outdated protocols expose data to interception.",
