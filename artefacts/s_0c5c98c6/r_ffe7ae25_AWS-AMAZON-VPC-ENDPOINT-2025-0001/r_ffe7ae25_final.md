    "Title": "Secure Connections with VPC Endpoints",
    "Risk Description": "Without secure connections using VPC endpoints, data traverses the public internet, increasing the risk of interception and exposure to cyber threats.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Unencrypted data over public networks can be intercepted, leading to unauthorized data access.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Data could potentially be tampered with during transmission over insecure networks.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Public network issues could lead to delays or disruptions in service connectivity."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to secure communications may not align with BACEN data protection requirements, LGPD mandates on data confidentiality, and PCI DSS for secure transmission of cardholder data.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Medium - Unauthorized data access is difficult to detect without proper monitoring, but can be mitigated by enforcing VPC endpoints.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Automate VPC Endpoint Policy Management",
    "Risk Description": "Improperly managed VPC endpoint policies can lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Mismanaged policies may permit access to sensitive data to unauthorized users.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Unauthorized users could alter data policy configurations, leading to further access expansion.",
      "Availability": "Low - Direct impact on service availability is limited."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with BACEN’s internal policy management protocols and LGPD’s principle of necessity could arise, risking regulatory penalties.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Medium - Policy misconfigurations can be detected with security tools, but might not be immediate.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Enforce Proper Condition Usage in VPC Endpoint Policies",
    "Risk Description": "Not enforcing conditions in policies can allow unrestricted access leading to security breaches.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Open policies without conditions expose sensitive data to unauthorized entities.",
      "Integrity": "High - Security breaches could compromise data integrity via unauthorized changes.",
      "Availability": "Low - Minimal direct impact on availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Could breach LGPD and BACEN regulations that require strict access control and monitoring.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "High",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Medium - Misconfigurations may go unnoticed until exploited, but using tools like AWS Config can aid detection.",
    "Risk Level": "Critical"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Audit VPC Endpoint Configurations",
    "Risk Description": "Without regular audits, VPC misconfigurations may remain undetected, resulting in potential security vulnerabilities.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Undetected misconfigurations could inadvertently expose data.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Persistent misconfigurations might impact data management processes.",
      "Availability": "Medium - Misconfigured endpoints could disrupt service access."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Failure to conduct regular audits may contravene BACEN and ISO 27001 requirements for continuous monitoring and vulnerability management.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Medium - Audits require manual effort but can be automated partially with scripts.",
    "Risk Level": "High"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Ensure Regional Compatibility for VPC Endpoints",
    "Risk Description": "Mismatched regional configurations could cause connectivity failures and service unavailability.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Low - Direct risk to data exposure is minimal.",
      "Integrity": "Low - There is little impact on data integrity.",
      "Availability": "High - Service disruptions can occur due to connectivity issues."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "While not directly regulatory, service availability issues may impact BACEN’s operational continuity requirements.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Low",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Low - Configuration mismatches are relatively easy to detect and rectify.",
    "Risk Level": "Medium"
  },
  {
    "Title": "Specify Gateway and Interface Endpoint Policies",
    "Risk Description": "Misconfigured policies can result in unauthorized access to critical resources and potential data breaches.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "High - Poorly defined policies can expose sensitive data.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Unauthorized access could lead to data manipulation.",
      "Availability": "Low - Does not directly affect availability."
    },
    "Regulatory & Compliance Impact": "Non-compliance with LGPD’s specific access control requirements and potential breaches of BACEN’s security protocols.",
    "Likelihood of Exploitation": "Medium",
    "Detection and Mitigation Difficulty": "Medium - Policy misconfigurations are detectable with continuous monitoring tools.",
    "Risk Level": "High"

  {
    "Title": "Strategic Deployment and Traffic Management for VPCs",
    "Risk Description": "Non-optimal deployment can introduce vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in traffic management.",
    "Impact Analysis": {
      "Confidentiality": "Medium - Inefficiencies might expose communication paths unintentionally.",
      "Integrity": "Medium - Poor management can lead to data routing errors.",
      "Availability": "High - Traffic inefficiencies can severely impact service availability."
