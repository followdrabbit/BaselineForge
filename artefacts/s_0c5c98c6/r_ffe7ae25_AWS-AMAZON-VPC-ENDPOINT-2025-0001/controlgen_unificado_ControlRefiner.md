    "Title": "Secure Connections with VPC Endpoints",
    "Description": "Ensure all AWS VPCs use endpoints to establish secure connections with AWS services, avoiding public network traffic. This reduces the risk of data interception by keeping traffic within AWS's private network.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS VPCs connecting to AWS services",
    "Security Risk": "Without VPC endpoints, public network traffic increases vulnerability to interception and exposure to threats.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "VPC endpoints are not enabled by default and must be configured manually.",
    "Automation": "Enforceable using AWS CloudFormation templates, AWS CLI, or Terraform. Monitor using AWS Config and CloudTrail.",

    "Title": "Automate VPC Endpoint Policy Management",
    "Description": "Use AWS CloudFormation, AWS CLI, or Terraform for deploying and updating VPC endpoint policies, ensuring they include specific Principals instead of wildcards and align with security requirements.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts managing VPC endpoint policies",
    "Security Risk": "Improper policies may lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not enforce restrictions on policy principals by default.",

    "Description": "Ensure VPC endpoint policies use conditions with Principals, avoiding unrestricted access through wildcards, and include adequate constraints for access control.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts with VPC endpoints",
    "Security Risk": "Wildcard usage without conditions can lead to unauthorized access and security breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Manual configuration required to enforce conditions on access policies.",

    "Title": "Audit VPC Endpoint Configurations",
    "Description": "Regularly audit VPC endpoint configurations using AWS CLI commands `describe-vpc-endpoints` and `describe-vpcs` to verify deployment across regions and ensure compliance with security best practices.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS environments with VPC endpoints",
    "Security Risk": "Without audits, misconfigurations may remain undetected, leading to security vulnerabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Manual auditing is necessary for verification.",

    "Security Risk": "Incorrect region configurations can cause connectivity failures, impacting service availability.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Automatic regional compatibility checks are not provided, requires manual validation.",

    "Security Risk": "Misconfigured policies can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Policies must be fine-tuned to align with organizational access requirements.",
