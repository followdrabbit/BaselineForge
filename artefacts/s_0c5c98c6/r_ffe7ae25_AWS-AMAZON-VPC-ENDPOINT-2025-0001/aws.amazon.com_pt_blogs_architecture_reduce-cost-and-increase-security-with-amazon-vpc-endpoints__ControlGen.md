    "Title": "Enforce Use of VPC Endpoints for Private Connectivity",
    "Description": "Ensure that VPC endpoints are employed to enable private connections between VPCs and AWS services, eliminating the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or other external connections. Configure this via AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or CloudFormation templates.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS VPCs connecting to AWS services",
    "Security Risk": "Without VPC endpoints, data traffic might traverse the internet, potentially leading to data interception and increased latency.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS does not automatically create VPC endpoints; they must be manually configured.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `vpc-endpoint-enabled` and monitored via Security Hub.",

    "Description": "Apply IAM resource policies to VPC Gateway Endpoints for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB to manage access via resource-based policies. Implement these policies to restrict access based on security requirements.",
    "Applicability": "All VPC Gateway Endpoints in use",
    "Security Risk": "Without specific policies, unauthorized access to data services can occur, leading to potential data breaches.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "IAM policies are flexible but require careful configuration to enforce security.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored using AWS Config to ensure policies are attached correctly, and through IAM Access Analyzer for policy validation.",

    "Title": "Ensure Granular Access Control for VPC Interface Endpoints",
    "Description": "Utilize IAM policies to enforce fine-grained access control over services accessed via VPC Interface Endpoints. Define policies at the service, user, or group level to restrict access appropriately.",
    "Applicability": "All VPC Interface Endpoints",
    "Security Risk": "Without proper access control, there is a risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources or services.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Security groups can be applied to control network traffic, but IAM policies require explicit configuration.",
    "Automation": "Enforce using IAM policies and validate with AWS Config rules to ensure compliance with access control policies.",

    "Security Risk": "Without proper traffic routing and inspection, malicious traffic might reach critical services unchecked.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Traffic inspection requires additional configuration and resource management for scaling.",

    "Security Risk": "Improper endpoint placement could lead to inefficient routing and potential security vulnerabilities.",
