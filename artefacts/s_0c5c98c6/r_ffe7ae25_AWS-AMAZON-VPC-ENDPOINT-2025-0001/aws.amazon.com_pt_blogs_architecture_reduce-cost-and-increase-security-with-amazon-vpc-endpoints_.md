This blog explains the benefits of using [Amazon VPC
endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-
endpoints.html) and highlights a [self-paced workshop](https://catalog.us-
east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/25daa7f1-11a5-4c96-8923-9b0e333acc59/en-
US) that will help you learn more about them. [Amazon Virtual Private
Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch [Amazon
Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) resources into a virtual network
that you’ve defined. This virtual network resembles a traditional network that
you’d operate in your own data center. The additional benefit is the ability
to use the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

A VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS
services. It doesn’t require you to deploy an internet gateway, network
address translation (NAT) device, Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection, or
[AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) connection.
Endpoints are virtual devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and
highly available VPC components. VPC endpoints allow communication between
instances in your VPC and services, without imposing availability risks or
bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

You can optimize the network path by avoiding traffic to internet gateways
and incurring cost associated with NAT gateways, NAT instances or maintaining
firewalls. VPC endpoints also provide you with much finer control over how
users and applications access AWS services. There are three types of VPC
endpoints: gateway load balancer endpoints, gateway endpoints, and interface
endpoints. Let’s take a look at each type of endpoint and how it is used.

The first type of endpoint, a _Gateway Load Balancer e_ ndpoint, allows you to
intercept traffic and route it to a network or security service that you’ve
configured using a [Gateway Load
Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/introduction.html).
Gateway load balancers enable you to deploy, scale, and manage virtual
appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and
deep packet inspection systems. Our colleague Justin Davies has written an
excellent blog post on [supported architectural patterns using AWS Gateway
Load Balancers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-
delivery/introducing-aws-gateway-load-balancer-supported-architecture-
patterns/).

The second type of endpoint, a _Gateway_ endpoint, allows you to provide
access to [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). You can configure
resource policies on both the gateway endpoint and the AWS resource that the
endpoint provides access to. A VPC endpoint policy is an [AWS Identity and
Access Management (AWS IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) resource policy that
you can attach to an endpoint. It is a separate policy for controlling access
from the endpoint to the specified service. This enables granular access
control and private network connectivity from within a VPC. For example, you
could create a policy that restricts access to a specific DynamoDB table. This
policy would only allow certain users or groups to access the table through a
VPC endpoint.

![Figure 1: Accessing Amazon S3 via a Gateway VPC
endpoint](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2020/08/05/VPC-
endpoints-1-1024x238.png)

Figure 1: Accessing Amazon S3 via a Gateway VPC endpoint

The third type of endpoint, an _Interface_ endpoint, allows you to connect to
services powered by [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/).
This includes a large number of AWS services. It also can also include
services hosted by other AWS customers, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners
in their own VPCs. By using AWS partner services through AWS PrivateLink, you
no longer have to rely on access to the public internet. Data transfer charges
for traffic from [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) to the internet
vary based on volume. After the first 1 GB / month ($0.00 per GB), transfers
are charged at a rate of $ 0.09/GB (for AWS US-East 1 Virginia). Like gateway
endpoints, interface endpoints can be secured using resource policies on the
endpoint itself, and the resource that the endpoint provides access to.
Interface endpoints allow the use of security groups to restrict access to the
endpoint.

![Figure 2: Accessing QLDB via an Interface VPC
endpoint](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2020/08/05/VPC-
endpoints-2-1024x272.png)

Figure 2: Accessing QLDB via an Interface VPC endpoint

An organization’s existing network design may influence where VPC Endpoints
are deployed. In larger multi-account AWS environments, network design can
vary considerably. Consider an organization that has built a hub-and-spoke
network with [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/).
VPCs have been provisioned into multiple AWS accounts, perhaps to facilitate
network isolation or to enable delegated network administration.

For distributed architectures, you can build a “shared services” VPC, which
provides centralized access to shared services required by workloads in each
of the VPCs. These shared services may include resources such as directory
services or VPC endpoints. Sharing resources from a central location instead
of building them in each VPC may reduce administrative overhead and cost.

This approach was outlined by our colleague Bhavin Desai in his blog post,
[Centralized DNS management of hybrid cloud with Amazon Route 53 and AWS
Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-
delivery/centralized-dns-management-of-hybrid-cloud-with-amazon-route-53-and-
aws-transit-gateway/). Instead of centralizing VPC endpoint deployment, a
network designer may choose to deploy endpoints within a spoke VPC to ensure
it is proximate to a single workload that will use the endpoint. This may
support workload specific security or performance considerations. Each
approach, centralizing and decentralizing, offers benefits. It is common to
use both to meet their specific requirements.

![Figure 3: Centralized VPC endpoints \(multiple
VPCs\)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2020/08/05/VPC-
endpoints-3-1024x401.png)

Figure 3: Centralized VPC endpoints (multiple VPCs)

Alternatively, an organization may have centralized its network and chosen to
leverage VPC sharing to enable multiple AWS accounts to create application
resources. Such an approach allows aggregating Amazon EC2 instances, [Amazon
Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (RDS) databases, and
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions into a shared,
centrally managed network. With either pattern, establishing a granular set of
controls to limit access to resources is critical to support organizational
security and compliance objectives. At the same time, it helps maintain
operational efficiency.

## Learn how with the VPC Endpoint Workshop

Understanding how to appropriately restrict access to endpoints and the
services they connect with can be confusing. Learn more by taking the [VPC
Endpoint Workshop.](https://catalog.us-
east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/25daa7f1-11a5-4c96-8923-9b0e333acc59/en-
US) Improve the security posture of your cloud workloads by using network
controls and VPC endpoint policies to manage access to your AWS resources.
