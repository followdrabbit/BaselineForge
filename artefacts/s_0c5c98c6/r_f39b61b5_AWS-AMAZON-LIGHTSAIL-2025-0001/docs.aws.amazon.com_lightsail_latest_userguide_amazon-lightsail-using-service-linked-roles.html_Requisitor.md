Below are the extracted technical and operational requirements from the Amazon Lightsail documentation that can be used to develop automated security controls:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon Lightsail service-linked roles like AWSServiceRoleForLightsail are automatically created when exporting instances or block storage disk snapshots to Amazon EC2.",
    "Reference": "[Creating a Service-Linked Role for Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles.html#creating-service-linked-role)",
    "Observations": "The role is not manually created but automatically provisioned by Lightsail upon specific actions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure IAM permissions allow Amazon Lightsail to automatically create the service-linked role AWSServiceRoleForLightsail.",
    "Reference": "[Service-Linked Role Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions)",
    "Observations": "IAM policies need to be configured to grant Lightsail the necessary creation permissions."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Prevent deletion of the AWSServiceRoleForLightsail service-linked role until all related Amazon Lightsail resources are deleted.",
    "Reference": "[Deleting a Service-Linked Role for Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles.html#deleting-service-linked-role)",
    "Observations": "Check for no pending copy state before deletion to avoid resource access issues."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Configure IAM policies to allow entities to manage service-linked roles, including creation, deletion, and description editing for AWSServiceRoleForLightsail.",
    "Reference": "Section Service-Linked Role Permissions - [Providing permissions to control service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#provide-permissions)",
    "Observations": "Use specific IAM policies to manage the lifecycle of service-linked roles effectively."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Limit IAM role actions to those necessary for Amazon Lightsail operations using service-linked role permissions for actions such as ec2:CopySnapshot and s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock.",
    "Reference": "[Service-Linked Role Permissions for Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions)",
    "Observations": "Restrict permissions to only those required actions on necessary resources to enhance security."
  }
]
```

These JSON objects extracted from the documentation specify criteria that can be implemented as automated security controls to ensure secure and efficient management of Amazon Lightsail service-linked roles.
