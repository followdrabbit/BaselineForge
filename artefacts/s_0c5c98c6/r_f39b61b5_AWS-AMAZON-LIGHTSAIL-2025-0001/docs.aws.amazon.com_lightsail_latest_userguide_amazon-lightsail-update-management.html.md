Instance blueprint software support

# Keep Lightsail instances and containers secure with update management

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Lightsail, and third-party application
vendors periodically update and patch the instance images (also known as
_blueprints_) that are available on Lightsail. AWS and Lightsail do not update
or patch the operating system or applications on instances after you create
them. Lightsail also does not update or patch the operating system and
software that you configure on your Lightsail container services. Therefore,
we recommend that you regularly update, patch, and secure the operating system
and applications on your Amazon Lightsail instances and container services.
For more information, see the [AWS Shared Responsibility
Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).

guides, and keeping your operating system and application up to date. You can

that are provided by the application vendor.
