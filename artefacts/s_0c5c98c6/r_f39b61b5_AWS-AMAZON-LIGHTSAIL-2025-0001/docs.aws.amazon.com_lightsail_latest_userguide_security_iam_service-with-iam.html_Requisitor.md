Here is a structured record of the technical and operational requirements extracted from the provided Amazon Lightsail documentation:

```json
[
    {
        "Description": "Use IAM identity-based policies to specify allowed or denied actions and resources with conditions. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element with the prefix 'lightsail:'.",
        "Reference": "Section: Lightsail Identity-Based Policies - Actions. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html",
        "Observations": "Ensure policies use the 'lightsail:' prefix for actions to correctly apply permissions."
    },
    {
        "Description": "When specifying resources in policies, use Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for resource-level permissions or wildcards (*) for actions that do not support specific resources.",
        "Reference": "Section: Lightsail Identity-Based Policies - Resources. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html",
        "Observations": "Consider the absence of resource-level permissions for certain Lightsail actions."
    },
    {
        "Description": "Use global condition keys in IAM policies for specifying conditions since Lightsail supports some global condition keys but not service-specific ones.",
        "Reference": "Section: Lightsail Identity-Based Policies - Condition Keys. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html",
        "Observations": "Verify compatibility of condition keys with Lightsail actions and resources for effective policy conditions."
    },
    {
        "Description": "Attach tags to Lightsail resources and include them in IAM policy condition elements to control access. Use 'lightsail:ResourceTag/key-name', 'aws:RequestTag/key-name', or 'aws:TagKeys' condition keys.",
        "Reference": "Section: Authorization Based on Lightsail Tags. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html",
        "Observations": "Some API actions may not support tag-based authorization, requiring additional verification."
    },
    {
        "Description": "Use temporary credentials with AWS Security Token Service (STS) operations such as AssumeRole and GetFederationToken to access Lightsail.",
        "Reference": "Section: Using Temporary Credentials with Lightsail. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html",
        "Observations": "Ensure temporary credentials are appropriately managed and secured."
    },
    {
        "Description": "Service-linked roles are supported by Lightsail and allow AWS services to access resources in other services. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for these roles.",
        "Reference": "Section: Service-Linked Roles. URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html",
        "Observations": "Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and require monitoring to ensure correct operation."
    }
]
```

These requirements outline how to effectively manage access and permissions within Amazon Lightsail using IAM policies, resource tags, and temporary credentials, highlighting areas that can be automated for security management.
