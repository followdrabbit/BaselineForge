    "Title": "Automated Updates and Patches for Amazon Lightsail Instances and Applications",
    "Description": "Ensure Amazon Lightsail instances and applications are regularly updated and patched to mitigate vulnerabilities. Implement automated scripts or use the instance's operating system package manager (e.g., apt for Ubuntu, yum for Amazon Linux) to schedule updates and patches.",
    "Applicability": "All Amazon Lightsail instances and container services",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to regularly update and patch the operating system and applications can lead to exploitation of known vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security incidents.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS and Lightsail do not automatically update or patch instances after creation. It is the customer's responsibility to configure and manage updates.",
    "Automation": "Automation requires using OS-native tools (e.g., cron jobs with package managers for Linux, task scheduler for Windows) to apply security patches regularly. Manual processes must be designed and tested.",

    "Title": "Implementation of Automatic Update Services for Lightsail Applications",
    "Description": "Utilize automatic update services provided by application vendors or configure recommended update mechanisms to ensure applications running on Lightsail instances are up-to-date.",
    "Applicability": "All applications hosted on Amazon Lightsail instances",
    "Security Risk": "Unpatched applications can be prone to exploits that compromise application functionality, data integrity, or expose sensitive data.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "The responsibility to enable and configure automatic updates services is on the user, as AWS does not provide automatic updates for applications on Lightsail.",
    "Automation": "Automate updates by configuring application-specific update settings or utilizing third-party update management tools that support automatic patching.",
