Here's a structured extraction of automatable security requirements from the given documentation, including technical and operational conditions:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Ensure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with temporary credentials are used instead of creating IAM users with long-term credentials for applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.",
    "Reference": "Section 'IAM roles' in the documentation - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html",
    "Observations": "Use an instance profile to assign an AWS role to EC2 instances to manage temporary credentials."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the AWS account root user and IAM users where applicable.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Authenticate with identities' in the documentation - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html",
    "Observations": "Recommended by AWS for enhanced security of accounts."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Rotate access keys regularly for IAM users that require long-term credentials.",
    "Reference": "Section 'IAM users and groups' in the documentation - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html",
    "Observations": "This is suggested to reduce the risk of credential exposure."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Use AWS Config to monitor and ensure IAM policies adhere to the principle of least privilege by granting minimal permissions necessary.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Manage access using policies' in the documentation - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html",
    "Observations": "Evaluate policies regularly to ensure compliance with the organization's security posture."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Set permissions boundaries for IAM entities to define the maximum permissions for identity-based policies.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Other policy types' in the documentation - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html",
    "Observations": "This ensures permissions are not exceeded beyond intended boundaries."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Utilize Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations to manage permissions centrally across accounts.",
    "Reference": "Section 'Other policy types' in the documentation - URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html",
    "Observations": "SCPs help in enforcing organizational security policies at a high level."
  }
]
```

These extracted requirements focus on security best practices and configurations that can potentially be automated using AWS services like IAM, AWS Config, and AWS Organizations.
