    "Title": "Deploy Subnets Across Multiple Availability Zones",
    "Description": "Ensure that subnets are set up in multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) to provide high availability and fault tolerance for applications running in VPC.",
    "Applicability": "All production environments",
    "Security Risk": "Failure to distribute subnets across multiple AZs could lead to outages in the event of an AZ failure, impacting service availability and resilience.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS allows creation of subnets in multiple AZs but does not enforce it by default. Manual configuration is required.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required. AWS Config rule cannot enforce cross-AZ subnet distribution.",

    "Title": "Use Security Groups to Control EC2 Instance Traffic",
    "Description": "Configure security groups to allow specific ingress and egress traffic to EC2 instances in VPC subnets, enhancing security by only permitting known traffic.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS environments using EC2 instances",
    "Security Risk": "Not using security groups can expose EC2 instances to unwanted traffic, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized access.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Security groups must be explicitly configured; no default inbound rule exists.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored using AWS Config rule `ec2-security-group-attached`.",

    "Title": "Implement Network ACLs at the Subnet Level",
    "Description": "Use network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic at a subnet level, providing an additional layer of security.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS environments with VPCs",
    "Security Risk": "Without network ACLs, subnets might be exposed to unauthorized traffic, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Network ACLs are stateless and are independent of security groups; must be configured manually.",
    "Automation": "Can be monitored using AWS Config for subnet configuration compliance.",

    "Title": "Enable VPC Flow Logs for Traffic Monitoring",
    "Description": "Activate VPC Flow Logs to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.",
    "Applicability": "All VPCs in all AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without VPC Flow Logs, suspicious activities or network traffic issues may go unnoticed, making it hard to detect and respond to security incidents.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "VPC Flow Logs are not enabled by default and require manual activation.",
    "Automation": "Can be enforced using AWS Config rule `vpc-flow-logs-enabled`.",

    "Description": "Utilize AWS Network Firewall to filter traffic entering and exiting VPCs, providing a high level of network security and threat protection.",
    "Applicability": "All VPCs requiring advanced network security",
    "Security Risk": "Without a network firewall, VPC traffic may be vulnerable to attacks or data exfiltration attempts.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "AWS Network Firewall needs to be deployed and configured based on specific security requirements; not enabled by default.",
    "Automation": "Manual validation required. Deployment must be configured through AWS Management Console or APIs.",

    "Title": "Activate Amazon GuardDuty for Threat Detection",
    "Description": "Enable Amazon GuardDuty to monitor VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs to detect suspicious activities and potential threats.",
    "Applicability": "All AWS accounts",
    "Security Risk": "Without GuardDuty, potential threats and suspicious activities may go undetected, risking the security of AWS workloads.",
    "Default Behavior / Limitations": "Amazon GuardDuty is not enabled by default and requires manual activation.",
    "Automation": "Can be enabled and managed through AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.",
