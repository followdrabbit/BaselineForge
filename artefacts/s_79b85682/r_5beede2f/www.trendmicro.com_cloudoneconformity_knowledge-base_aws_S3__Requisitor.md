To extract the automatable security requirements from the provided Trend Micro Cloud One Conformity knowledge base documentation for AWS S3, I have analyzed the Markdown content and structured the identified requirements into a JSON format. Here are the extracted requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon S3 Server Access Logging uses a different bucket for storing access logs.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/server-access-log-storage-different-bucket.html",
    "Observations": "Helps in maintaining access logs separately for security and audit trails."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon S3 public access is blocked at the AWS account level for data protection.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/account-public-access-block.html",
    "Observations": "Blocks public access at account level for better security."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that Amazon S3 public access is blocked at the S3 bucket level for data protection.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/bucket-public-access-block.html",
    "Observations": "Public access should be disabled directly on the bucket."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow FULL_CONTROL access to AWS authenticated users via ACLs.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/s3-bucket-authenticated-users-full-control-access.html",
    "Observations": "Restrict FULL_CONTROL to prevent unauthorized access."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled for security and access audits.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/s3-bucket-logging-enabled.html",
    "Observations": "Access logging is crucial for audits and investigations."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure S3 buckets have an MFA-Delete policy to prevent deletion of files without an MFA token.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/s3-bucket-mfa-delete-enabled.html",
    "Observations": "MFA-Delete adds an extra layer of security against accidental deletion."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow public access via bucket policies.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/s3-bucket-public-access-via-policy.html",
    "Observations": "Bucket policy should not be configured to allow public access."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure AWS S3 buckets enforce SSL to secure data in transit.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/secure-transport.html",
    "Observations": "SSL is essential for encrypting data in transit."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure AWS S3 buckets enforce Server-Side Encryption (SSE).",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/server-side-encryption.html",
    "Observations": "SSE ensures data is encrypted at rest."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that AWS S3 buckets utilize lifecycle configurations to manage S3 objects during their lifetime.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/lifecycle-configuration.html",
    "Observations": "Lifecycle rules help in managing storage costs and data archival."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that S3 buckets do not allow unknown cross-account access via bucket policies.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/s3-cross-account-access.html",
    "Observations": "Prevent cross-account access without proper validation."
  },
  {
    "Description": "Ensure that S3 Log Delivery Group write permissions are denied for the S3 source bucket.",
    "Reference": "https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/aws/S3/deny-log-delivery-group-write-permission.html",
    "Observations": "Denying write permissions enhances security against unauthorized data modifications."
  }

```

These requirements are tailored to automate security controls using AWS services, including AWS Config, CloudTrail, and ACLs, to enhance the security and governance posture of Amazon S3 in the cloud.
