This assessment considers the critical need for protecting sensitive customer data and ensuring compliance with Brazilian regulations (BACEN, LGPD) and international standards (ISO 27001, PCI DSS) in the financial sector. Each risk level reflects the potential impact on the CIA triad and compliance issues that could arise from not implementing these controls.
