Based on the provided Amazon S3 security guidance documentation, several technical and operational requirements can be extracted and structured into automated security controls. These requirements are derived from the guidelines and can be used to strengthen the security posture of S3 resources in AWS environments.

Here is the structured output in JSON format:
